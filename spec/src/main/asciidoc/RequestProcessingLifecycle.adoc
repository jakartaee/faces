== Request Processing Lifecycle

Web user interfaces generally follow a
pattern where the user-agent sends one or more requests to the server
with the end goal of displaying a user-interface. In the case of Web
browsers, an initial HTTP GET or POST request is made to the server,
which responds with a document which the browser interprets and
automatically makes subsequent requests on the user’s behalf. The
responses to each of these subsequent requests are usually images,
JavaScript files, CSS Style Sheets, and other artifacts that fit “into”
the original document. If the JSF lifecycle is involved in rendering the
initial response, the entire process of initial request, the response to
that request, and any subsequent requests made automatically by the
user-agent, and their responses, is called a _Faces View
Request/Response_ for discussion. The following graphic illustrates a
Faces View Request/Response.

image:SF-11.png[image]

Each Faces View Request/Response goes through
a well-defined _request processing lifecycle_ made up of _phases_ .
There are three different scenarios that must be considered, each with
its own combination of phases and activities:

Non-Faces Request generates Faces Response

Faces Request generates Faces Response

Faces Request generates Non-Faces Response

Where the terms being used are defined as
follows:

 _Faces Response_ —A response that was
created by the execution of the _Render Response_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle.

 _Non-Faces Response_ —A response that was
not created by the execution of the _render response_ phase of the
request processing lifecycle. Examples would be a servlet-generated or
JSP-rendered response that does not incorporate JSF components, a
response that sets an HTTP status code other than the usual 200 (such as
a redirect), or a response whose HTTP body consists entirely of the
bytes of an in page resource, such as a JavaScript file, a CSS file, an
image, or an applet. This last scenario is considered a special case of
a Non-Faces Response and will be referred to as a _Faces Resource
Response_ for the remainder of this specification.

 _Faces Request_ —A request that was sent
from a previously generated _Faces response_ . Examples would be a
hyperlink or form submit from a rendered user interface component, where
the request URI was crafted (by the component or renderer that created
it) to identify the view to use for processing the request. Another
example is a request for a resource that the user-agent was instructed
to fetch an artifact such as an image, a JavaScript file, a CSS
stylesheet, or an applet. This last scenario is considered a special
case of a Faces Request and will be referred to as a _Faces Resource
Request_ for the remainder of this specification.

 _Non-Faces Request_ —A request that was sent
to an application component (e.g. a servlet or JSP page), rather than
directed to a Faces view.

In addition, of course, your web application
may receive non-Faces requests that generate non-Faces responses.
Because such requests do not involve JavaServer Faces at all, their
processing is outside the scope of this specification, and will not be
considered further.

READER NOTE: The dynamic behavior
descriptions in this Chapter make forward references to the sections
that describe the individual classes and interfaces. You will probably
find it useful to follow the reference and skim the definition of each
new class or interface as you encounter them, then come back and finish
the behavior description. Later, you can study the characteristics of
each JSF API in the subsequent chapters.

[[a383]]
=== Request Processing Lifecycle Scenarios

Each of the scenarios described above has a
lifecycle that is composed of a particular set of phases, executed in a
particular order. The scenarios are described individually in the
following subsections.

=== Non-Faces Request Generates Faces Response

An application that is processing a non-Faces
request may use JSF to render a Faces response to that request. In order
to accomplish this, the application must perform the common activities
that are described in the following sections:

Acquire Faces object references, as described
in link:JSF.html#a502[See Acquire Faces Object References],
below.

Create a new view, as described in
link:JSF.html#a516[See Create And Configure A New View], below.

Store the view into the _FacesContext_ by
calling the _setViewRoot()_ method on the _FacesContext._

=== [[a390]]Faces Request Generates Faces Response

The most common lifecycle will be the case
where a previous Faces response includes user interface controls that
will submit a subsequent request to this web application, utilizing a
request URI that is mapped to the JSF implementation’s controller, as
described in link:JSF.html#a6076[See Servlet Mapping]. Because
such a request will be initially handled by the JSF implementation, the
application need not take any special steps—its event listeners,
validators, and application actions will be invoked at appropriate times
as the standard request processing lifecycle, described in the following
diagrams, is invoked.

image:SF-13.png[image]

The “Handle Resource Request” box, and its
subsequent boxes, are explained in link:JSF.html#a746[See
Resource Handling]. The following diagram explains the “Execute and
Render Lifecycle” box.

image:SF-14.png[image]

The behavior of the individual phases of the
request processing lifecycle are described in individual subsections of
link:JSF.html#a401[See Standard Request Processing Lifecycle
Phases]. Note that, at the conclusion of several phases of the request
processing lifecycle, common event processing logic (as described in
link:JSF.html#a494[See Common Event Processing]) is performed
to broadcast any _FacesEvents_ generated by components in the component
tree to interested event listeners.

=== Faces Request Generates Non-Faces Response

Normally, a JSF-based application will
utilize the _Render Response_ phase of the request processing lifecycle
to actually create the response that is sent back to the client. In some
circumstances, however, this behavior might not be desirable. For
example:

A Faces Request needs to be redirected to a
different web application resource (via a call to
_HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect_ ).

A Faces Request causes the generation of a
response using some other technology (such as a servlet, or a JSP page
not containing JSF components).

A Faces Request causes the generation of a
response simply by serving up the bytes of a resource, such as an image,
a JavaScript file, a CSS file, or an applet

In any of these scenarios, the application
will have used the standard mechanisms of the servlet or portlet API to
create the response headers and content. It is then necessary to tell
the JSF implementation that the response has already been created, so
that the _Render Response_ phase of the request processing lifecycle
should be skipped. This is accomplished by calling the
_responseComplete()_ method on the _FacesContext_ instance for the
current request, prior to returning from event handlers or application
actions.


[[a401]]
=== Standard Request Processing Lifecycle Phases

The standard phases of the request processing
lifecycle are described in the following subsections.

{empty}[P1-start-currentPhaseId]The default
request lifecycle processing implementation must ensure that the
_currentPhaseId_ property of the _FacesContext_ instance for this
request is set with the proper _PhaseId_ constant for the current phase
as early as possible at the beginning of each phase.[P1-end]

=== [[a404]]Restore View

[P1-start-restoreView]The JSF implementation
must perform the following tasks during the _Restore View_ phase of the
request processing lifecycle:

Call _initView()_ on the _ViewHandler_ . This
will set the character encoding properly for this request.

Examine the _FacesContext_ instance for the
current request. If it already contains a _UIViewRoot_ :

 Set the _locale_ on this _UIViewRoot_ to the
value returned by the _getRequestLocale()_ method on the
_ExternalContext_ for this request.

Take no further action during this phase, and
return. The presence of a UIViewRoot already installed in the
FacesContext before the Restore View Phase implementation indicates that
the phase should assume the view has already been restored by other
means.

Derive the _viewId_ according to the
following algorithm, or one semantically equivalent to it.

 Look in the request map for a value under
the key _javax.servlet.include.path_info_ . If found, let it be the
_viewId_ .

Call _getRequestPathInfo()_ on the current
_ExternalContext_ . If this value is non-null, let this be the _viewId_
.

Look in the request map for a value under the
key _javax.servlet.include.servlet_path_ . If found, let it be the
_viewId_ .

If none of these steps yields a non- _null_
viewId, throw a _FacesException_ with an appropriate localized message.

Determine if this request is a postback or
initial request by executing the following algorithm. Find the
render-kit-id for the current request by calling
_calculateRenderKitId()_ on the _Application_ ’s _ViewHandler_ . Get
that _RenderKit_ ’s _ResponseStateManager_ and call its _isPostback()_
method, passing the current _FacesContext_ . If the current request is
an attempt by the servlet container to display a servlet error page, do
not interpret the request as a postback, even if it is indeed a
postback.

If the request is a postback, call
_setProcessingEvents(false)_ on the current _FacesContext_ . Then call
_ViewHandler.restoreView()_ , passing the _FacesContext_ instance for
the current request and the view identifier, and returning a
_UIViewRoot_ for the restored view. If the return from
_ViewHandler.restoreView()_ is null, throw a _ViewExpiredException_ with
an appropriate error message.
_javax.faces.application.ViewExpiredException_ is a _FacesException_
that must be thrown to signal to the application that the expected view
was not returned for the view identifier. An application may choose to
perform some action based on this exception.

Store the restored _UIViewRoot_ in the
_FacesContext_ .

Call _setProcessingEvents(true)_ on the
current _FacesContext_ . __

If the request is not a postback, try to
obtain the _ViewDeclarationLanguage_ from the _ViewHandler_ , for the
current _viewId_ by calling _ViewHandler.deriveLogicalViewId()_ and
passing the result to _ViewHandler.getViewDeclarationLanguage()_ . If no
such instance can be obtained, call _facesContext.renderResponse()_ .
Otherwise, call _getViewMetadata()_ on the _ViewDeclarationLanguage_
instance. If the result is non- _null_ , call _createMetadataView()_ on
the _ViewMetadata_ instance. Call _ViewMetadata.hasMetadata()_ , passing
the newly created _viewRoot_ . If this method returns false, call
_facesContext.renderResponse()_ . If it turns out that the previous call
to _createViewMetadata()_ did not create a _UIViewRoot_ instance, call
_createView()_ on the _ViewHandler_ .

=== View Protection

Call
ViewHandler.getProtectedViewsUnmodifiable() to determine if the view for
this viewId is protected. If not, assume the requested view is not
protected and take no additional view protection steps. Obtain the value
of the value of the request parameter whose name is given by the value
of ResponseStateManager.NON_POSTBACK_VIEW_TOKEN_PARAM. If there is no
value, throw ProtectedViewException. If the value is present, compare it
to the return from
ResponseStateManager.getCryptographicallyStrongTokenFromSession(). If
the values do not match, throw ProtectedViewException. If the values do
match, look for a Referer [sic] request header. If the header is
present, use the protected view API to determine if any of the declared
protected views match the value of the Referer header. If so, conclude
that the previously visited page is also a protected view and it is
therefore safe to continue. Otherwise, try to determine if the value of
the Referer header corresponds to any of the views in the current web
application. If not, throw a ProtectedViewException. If the Origin
header is present, additionally perform the same steps as with the
Referer header.

Call _renderResponse()_ on the _FacesContext_
.

Obtain a reference to the _FlowHandler_ from
the _Application_ . Call its _clientWindowTransition()_ method. This
ensures that navigation that happened as a result of the renderer for
the _javax.faces.OutcomeTarget_ component-family is correctly handled
with respect to flows. For example, this enables _<h:button>_ to work
correctly with flows.

Using _Application.publishEvent()_ , publish
a _PostAddToViewEvent_ with the created _UIViewRoot_ as the event
source.

{empty}In all cases, the implementation must
ensure that the restored tree is traversed and the
_PostRestoreStateEvent_ is published for every node in the tree.[P1-end]

At the end of this phase, the _viewRoot_
property of the _FacesContext_ instance for the current request will
reflect the saved configuration of the view generated by the previous
Faces Response, or a new view returned by _ViewHandler.createView()_ for
the view identifier.

=== [[a427]]Apply Request Values

The purpose of the _Apply Request Values_
phase of the request processing lifecycle is to give each component the
opportunity to update its current state from the information included in
the current request (parameters, headers, cookies, and so on). When the
information from the current request has been examined to update the
component’s current state, the component is said to have a “local
value”.

[P1-start-applyRequestDecode]During the
_Apply Request Values_ phase, the JSF implementation must call the
_processDecodes()_ method of the _UIViewRoot_ of the component
tree.[P1-end] This will normally cause the _processDecodes()_ method of
each component in the tree to be called recursively, as described in the
Javadocs for the _UIComponent.processDecodes()_ method.
[P1-start-partialDecode] The _processDecodes()_ method must determine if
the current request is a “partial request” by calling
_FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()_
. If
_FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()_
returns _true_ , perform the sequence of steps as outlined in
link:JSF.html#a436[See
Apply Request Values Partial Processing].[P1-end] Details of the
decoding process follow.

During the decoding of request values, some
components perform special processing, including:

Components that implement _ActionSource_
(such as _UICommand_ ), which recognize that they were activated, will
queue an _ActionEvent_ . The event will be delivered at the end of
_Apply Request Values_ phase if the _immediate_ property of the
component is _true_ , or at the end of _Invoke Application_ phase if it
is _false_ .

Components that implement
_EditableValueHolder_ (such as _UIInput_ ), and whose _immediate_
property is set to _true_ , will cause the conversion and validation
processing (including the potential to fire _ValueChangeEvent_ events)
that normally happens during _Process Validations_ phase to occur during
_Apply Request Values_ phase instead.

As described in
link:JSF.html#a494[See Common Event Processing], the
_processDecodes()_ method on the _UIViewRoot_ component at the root of
the component tree will have caused any queued events to be broadcast to
interested listeners.

{empty}At the end of this phase, all
_EditableValueHolder_ components in the component tree will have been
updated with new submitted values included in this request (or enough
data to reproduce incorrect input will have been stored, if there were
conversion errors). [P1-start-applyRequestConversion]In addition,
conversion and validation will have been performed on
_EditableValueHolder_ components whose _immediate_ property is set to
_true_ , as described in the _UIInput_ Javadocs. Conversions and
validations that failed will have caused messages to be enqueued via
calls to the _addMessage()_ method of the _FacesContext_ instance for
the current request, and the _valid_ property on the corresponding
component(s) will be set to _false_ . [P1-end]

{empty}If any of the _decode()_ methods that
were invoked, or an event listener that processed a queued event, called
_responseComplete()_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the current
request, clear the remaining events from the event queue and terminate
lifecycle processing of the current request.
[P1-start-applyRequestComplete]If any of the _decode()_ methods that
were invoked, or an event listener that processed a queued event, called
_renderResponse()_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the current
request, clear the remaining events from the event queue and transfer
control to the _Render Response_ phase of the request processing
lifecycle. Otherwise, control must proceed to the _Process Validations_
phase.[P1-end]

=== [[a436]]Apply Request Values Partial Processing

{empty}[P1-start-apply-partial-processing]Call
FacesContext.getPartialViewContext(). Call
PartialViewContext.processPartial() passing the FacesContext,
PhaseID.APPLY_REQUEST_VALUES as arguments. [P1-end]

=== [[a438]]Process Validations

As part of the creation of the view for this
request, zero or more _Validator_ instances may have been registered for
each component. In addition, component classes themselves may implement
validation logic in their _validate()_ methods.

[P1-start-validation]During the _Process
Validations_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, the JSF
implementation must call the _processValidators()_ method of the
_UIViewRoot_ of the tree.[P1-end] This will normally cause the
_processValidators()_ method of each component in the tree to be called
recursively, as described in the API reference for the
_UIComponent.processValidators()_ method. [P1-start-partialValidate] The
_processValidators()_ method must determine if the current request is a
“partial request” by calling
_FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()_
. If
_FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()_
returns _true_ , perform the sequence of steps as outlined in
link:JSF.html#a444[See
Partial Validations Partial Processing].[P1-end] Note that
_EditableValueHolder_ components whose _immediate_ property is set to
_true_ will have had their conversion and validation processing
performed during _Apply Request Values_ phase.

During the processing of validations, events
may have been queued by the components and/or _Validator_ s whose
_validate()_ method was invoked. As described in
link:JSF.html#a494[See Common Event Processing], the
_processValidators()_ method on the _UIViewRoot_ component at the root
of the component tree will have caused any queued events to be broadcast
to interested listeners.

At the end of this phase, all conversions and
configured validations will have been completed. Conversions and
Validations that failed will have caused messages to be enqueued via
calls to the _addMessage()_ method of the _FacesContext_ instance for
the current request, and the _valid_ property on the corresponding
components will have been set to _false_ .

{empty}If any of the _validate()_ methods
that were invoked, or an event listener that processed a queued event,
called _responseComplete()_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the
current request, clear the remaining events from the event queue and
terminate lifecycle processing of the current request.
[P1-start-validationValidate]If any of the _validate()_ methods that
were invoked, or an event listener that processed a queued event, called
_renderResponse()_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the current
request, clear the remaining events from the event queue and transfer
control to the _Render Response_ phase of the request processing
lifecycle. Otherwise, control must proceed to the _Update Model Values_
phase.[P1-end]

=== [[a444]]Partial Validations Partial Processing

{empty}[P1-start-val-partial-processing]Call
FacesContext.getPartialViewContext(). Call
PartialViewContext.processPartial() passing the FacesContext,
PhaseID.PROCESS_VALIDATIONS as arguments. [P1-end]

=== [[a446]]Update Model Values

If this phase of the request processing
lifecycle is reached, it is assumed that the incoming request is
syntactically and semantically valid (according to the validations that
were performed), that the local value of every component in the
component tree has been updated, and that it is now appropriate to
update the application's model data in preparation for performing any
application events that have been enqueued.

[P1-start-updateModel]During the _Update
Model Values_ phase, the JSF implementation must call the
_processUpdates()_ method of the _UIViewRoot_ component of the
tree.[P1-end] This will normally cause the _processUpdates()_ method of
each component in the tree to be called recursively, as described in the
API reference for the _UIComponent.processUpdates()_ method.
[P1-start-partialUpdate] The _processUpdates()_ method must determine if
the current request is a “partial request” by calling
_FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()_
. If
_FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()_
returns _true_ , perform the sequence of steps as outlined in
link:JSF.html#a452[See
Update Model Values Partial Processing]. [P1-end]The actual model update
for a particular component is done in the _updateModel()_ method for
that component.

During the processing of model updates,
events may have been queued by the components whose _updateModel()_
method was invoked. As described in link:JSF.html#a494[See
Common Event Processing], the _processUpdates()_ method on the
UIViewRoot component at the root of the component tree will have caused
any queued events to be broadcast to interested listeners.

At the end of this phase, all appropriate
model data objects will have had their values updated to match the local
value of the corresponding component, and the component local values
will have been cleared.

{empty}If any of the _updateModel()_ methods
that were invoked, or an event listener that processed a queued event,
called _responseComplete()_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the
current request, clear the remaining events from the event queue and
terminate lifecycle processing of the current request.
[P1-start-updateModelComplete]If any of the _updateModel()_ methods that
was invoked, or an event listener that processed a queued event, called
_renderResponse()_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the current
request, clear the remaining events from the event queue and transfer
control to the _Render Response_ phase of the request processing
lifecycle. Otherwise, control must proceed to the _Invoke Application_
phase.[P1-end]

=== [[a452]]Update Model Values Partial Processing

{empty}[P1-start-upd-partial-processing]Call
FacesContext.getPartialViewContext(). Call
PartialViewContext.processPartial() passing the FacesContext,
PhaseID.UPDATE_MODEL_VALUES as arguments. [P1-end]

=== [[a454]]Invoke Application

If this phase of the request processing
lifecycle is reached, it is assumed that all model updates have been
completed, and any remaining event broadcast to the application needs to
be performed. [P1-start-invokeApplication]The implementation must ensure
that the _processApplication()_ method of the _UIViewRoot_ instance is
called.[P1-end] The default behavior of this method will be to broadcast
any queued events that specify a phase identifier of
_PhaseId.INVOKE_APPLICATION_ . If _responseComplete()_ was called on the
_FacesContext_ instance for the current request, clear the remaining
events from the event queue and terminate lifecycle processing of the
current request. If _renderResponse()_ was called on the _FacesContext_
instance for the current request, clear the remaining events from the
event queue.

{empty}Advanced applications (or application
frameworks) may replace the default _ActionListener_ instance by calling
the _setActionListener()_ method on the _Application_ instance for this
application. [P1-start-invokeApplicationListener]However, the JSF
implementation must provide a default _ActionListener_ instance that
behaves as described in link:JSF.html#a3402[See ActionListener
Property].[P1-end]

=== [[a457]]Render Response

This phase accomplishes two things:

Causes the response to be rendered to the
client

Causes the state of the response to be saved
for processing on subsequent requests.

JSF supports a range of approaches that JSF
implementations may utilize in creating the response text that
corresponds to the contents of the response view, including:

Deriving all of the response content directly
from the results of the encoding methods (on either the components or
the corresponding renderers) that are called.

Interleaving the results of component
encoding with content that is dynamically generated by application
programming logic.

Interleaving the results of component
encoding with content that is copied from a static “template” resource.

Interleaving the results of component
encoding by embedding calls to the encoding methods into a dynamic
resource (such as representing the components as custom tags in a JSP
page).

Because of the number of possible options,
the mechanism for implementing the _Render Response_ phase cannot be
specified precisely. [P1-start-renderResponse]However, all JSF
implementations of this phase must conform to the following
requirements:

If it is possible to obtain a
_ViewDeclarationLanguage_ instance for the current _viewId_ , from the
_ViewHandler_ , its _buildView()_ method must be called. __

Publish the
_javax.faces.event.PreRenderViewEvent_ .

JSF implementations must provide a default
_ViewHandler_ implementation that is capable of handling views written
in JSP as well as views written in the Faces View Declaration Language
(VDL). In the case of JSP, the ViewHandler must perform a
_RequestDispatcher.forward()_ call to a web application resource whose
context-relative path is equal to the view identifier of the component
tree.

If all of the response content is being
derived from the encoding methods of the component or associated
_Renderer_ s, the component tree should be walked in the same
depth-first manner as was used in earlier phases to process the
component tree, but subject to the additional constraints listed here.
Generally this is handled by a call to _ViewHandler.renderView()_ . __

If the response content is being interleaved
from additional sources and the encoding methods, the components may be
selected for rendering in any desired orderlink:#a9083[1].

During the rendering process, additional
components may be added to the component tree based on information
available to the _ViewHandler_ implementationlink:#a9084[2].
However, before adding a new component, the _ViewHandler_ implementation
must first check for the existence of the corresponding component in the
component tree. If the component already exists (perhaps because a
previous phase has pre-created one or more components), the existing
component’s properties and attributes must be utilized.

Under no circumstances should a component be
selected for rendering when its parent component, or any of its
ancestors in the component tree, has its _rendersChildren_ property set
to true. In such cases, the parent or ancestor component must render the
content of this child component when the parent or ancestor was
selected.

If the _isRendered()_ method of a component
returns _false_ , the renderer for that component must not generate any
markup, and none of its facets or children (if any) should be rendered.

It must be possible for the application to
programmatically modify the component tree at any time during the
request processing lifecycle (except during the rendering of the view)
and have the system behave as expected. For example, the following must
be permitted. Modification of the view during rendering may lead to
undefined results. It must be possible to allow components added by the
templating system (such as JSP) to be removed from the tree before
rendering. It must be possible to programmatically add components to the
tree and have them render in the proper place in the hierarchy. It must
be possible to re-order components in the tree before rendering. These
manipulations do require that any components added to the tree have ids
that are unique within the scope of the closest parent _NamingContainer_
component. The value of the _rendersChildren_ property is handled as
expected, and may be either _true_ or _false_ .

If running on a container that supports
Servlet 4.0 or later, after any dynamic component manipulations have
been completed, any resources that have been added to the UIViewRoot,
such as scripts, images, or stylesheets, and any inline images, must be
pushed to the client using the Servlet Server Push API. All of the
pushes must be started before any of the HTML of the response is
rendered to the client.

For partial requests, where partial view
rendering is required, there must be no content written outside of the
view (outside _f:view_ ). Response writing must be disabled. Response
writing must be enabled again at the start of _encodeBegin._

When each particular component in the
component tree is selected for rendering, calls to its _encodeXxx()_
methods must be performed in the manner described in
link:JSF.html#a1041[See Component Specialization Methods]. For
components that implement _ValueHolder_ (such as _UIInput_ and
_UIOutput_ ), data conversion must occur as described in the _UIOutput_
Javadocs.

{empty}Upon completion of rendering, but
before state saving the JSF runtime must publish a
_javax.faces.event.PostRenderViewEvent_ . After doing so the JSF runtime
must save the completed state using the methods of the class
_StateManager._ This state information must be made accessible on a
subsequent request, so that the _Restore View_ can access it.[P1-end]
For more on _StateManager_ , see link:JSF.html#a4140[See State
Saving Methods.]

=== [[a480]]Render Response Partial Processing

[P1-start-render-partial-processing]
According to _UIViewRoot.encodeChildren()_ ,
_FacesContext.processPartial(PhaseId.RENDER_RESPONSE)_ , will be called
if and only if the current request is an Ajax request. Take these
actions in this case.

On the _ExternalContext_ for the request,
call _setResponseContentType("text/xml")_ and
_addResponseHeader("Cache-control", "no-cache")_ . Call
_startDocument()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ .

Call _writePreamble(“<?xml version=’1.0’
encoding=’currentEncoding’?>\n”)_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ , where
_encoding_ is the return from the _getCharacterEncoding()_ on the
_PartialResponseWriter_ , or UTF-8 if that method returns _null_ . __

If _isResetValues()_ returns _true_ , call
_getRenderIds()_ and pass the result to _UIViewRoot.resetValues()_ . __

If _isRenderAll()_ returns _true_ and the
view root is not an instance of _NamingContainer_ , call
_startUpdate(PartialResponseWriter.RENDER_ALL_MARKER)_ on the
_PartialResponseWriter_ . For each child of the _UIViewRoot_ , call
_encodeAll()_ . Call _endUpdate()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ .
Render the state using the algorithm described below in
link:JSF.html#a487[See Partial State Rendering], call
_endDocument()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ and return. If
_isRenderAll()_ returns _true_ and this _UIViewRoot_ is a
_NamingContainer_ , treat this as a case where _isRenderAll()_ returned
_false_ , but use the _UIViewRoot_ itself as the one and only component
from which the tree visit must start.

If _isRenderAll()_ returns _false_ , if there
are ids to render, visit the subset of components in the tree to be
rendered in similar fashion as for other phases, but for each
_UIComponent_ in the traversal, call _startUpdate(id)_ on the
_PartialResponseWriter_ , where _id_ is the client id of the component.
Call _encodeAll()_ on the component, and then _endUpdate()_ on the
_PartialResponseWriter_ . If there are no ids to render, this step is
un-necessary. After the subset of components (if any) have been
rendered, Render the state using the algorithm described below in
link:JSF.html#a487[See Partial State Rendering], call
_endDocument()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ and return.

=== [[a487]]Partial State Rendering

This section describes the requirements for
rendering the _<update>_ elements pertaining to view state and window id
in the case of partial response rendering.

If the view root is marked transient, take no
action and return.

Obtain a unique id for the view state, as
described in the JavaDocs for the constant field
_ResponseStateManager.VIEW_STATE_PARAM_ . Pass this id to a call to
_startUpdate()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ . Obtain the view state
to render by calling _getViewState()_ on the application’s
_StateManager_ . Write the state by calling _write()_ on the
_PartialResponseWriter_ , passing the state as the argument. Call
_endUpdate()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ .

If _getClientWindow()_ on the
_ExternalContext_ , returns non- _null_ , obtain an id for the
_<update>_ element for the window id as described in the JavaDocs for
the constant _ResponseStateManager.WINDOW_ID_PARAM_ . Pass this id to a
call to _startUpdate()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ . Call _write()_
on that same writer, passing the result of calling _getId()_ on the
_ClientWindow_ . Call _endUpdate()_ on the _PartialResponseWriter_ .

=== Common Event Processing

For a complete description of the event
processing model for JavaServer Faces components, see
link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener Model].

During several phases of the request
processing lifecycle, as described in link:JSF.html#a401[See
Standard Request Processing Lifecycle Phases], the possibility exists
for events to be queued (via a call to the _queueEvent()_ method on the
source _UIComponent_ instance, or a call to the _queue()_ method on the
_FacesEvent_ instance), which must now be broadcast to interested event
listeners. The broadcast is performed as a side effect of calling the
appropriate lifecycle management method ( _processDecodes()_ ,
_processValidators()_ , _processUpdates()_ , or _processApplication()_ )
on the _UIViewRoot_ instance at the root of the current component tree.

[P1-start-eventBroadcast]For each queued
event, the _broadcast()_ method of the source _UIComponent_ must be
called to broadcast the event to all event listeners who have registered
an interest, on this source component for events of the specified type,
after which the event is removed from the event queue.[P1-end] See the
API reference for the _UIComponent.broadcast()_ method for the detailed
functional requirements.

{empty}It is also possible for event
listeners to cause additional events to be enqueued for processing
during the current phase of the request processing lifecycle.
[P1-start-eventOrder]Such events must be broadcast in the order they
were enqueued, after all originally queued events have been broadcast,
before the lifecycle management method returns.[P1-end]


=== Common Application Activities

The following subsections describe common
activities that may be undertaken by an application that is using JSF to
process an incoming request and/or create an outgoing response. Their
use is described in link:JSF.html#a383[See Request Processing
Lifecycle Scenarios], for each request processing lifecycle scenario in
which the activity is relevant.

=== [[a502]]Acquire Faces Object References

This phase is only required when the request
being processed was not submitted from a previous response, and
therefore did not initiate the _Faces Request Generates Faces Response_
lifecycle. In order to generate a Faces Response, the application must
first acquire references to several objects provided by the JSF
implementation, as described below.

=== Acquire and Configure Lifecycle Reference

[P1-start-lifeReference]As described in
link:JSF.html#a6608[See Lifecycle], the JSF implementation must
provide an instance of _javax.faces.lifecycle.Lifecycle_ that may be
utilized to manage the remainder of the request processing
lifecycle.[P1-end] An application may acquire a reference to this
instance in a portable manner, as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
LifecycleFactory lFactory =
(LifecycleFactory)
FactoryFinder.getFactory(FactoryFinder.LIFECYCLE_FACTORY);

Lifecycle lifecycle =
lFactory.getLifecycle(LifecycleFactory.DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE);

|===

It is also legal to specify a different
lifecycle identifier as a parameter to the _getLifecycle()_ method, as
long as this identifier is recognized and supported by the JSF
implementation you are using. However, using a non-default lifecycle
identifier will generally not be portable to any other JSF
implementation.

=== Acquire and Configure FacesContext Reference

[P1-start-contextReference]As described in
link:JSF.html#a3091[See FacesContext], the JSF implementation
must provide an instance of _javax.faces.context.FacesContext_ to
contain all of the per-request state information for a Faces Request or
a Faces Response. An application that is processing a Non-Faces Request,
but wants to create a Faces Response, must acquire a reference to a
_FacesContext_ instance as follows

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
FacesContextFactory fcFactory =
(FacesContextFactory)
FactoryFinder.getFactory(FactoryFinder.FACES_CONTEXT_FACTORY);

FacesContext facesContext =

 fcFactory.getFacesContext(context, request,
response, lifecycle);



|===

where the _context_ , _request_ , and
_response_ objects represent the corresponding instances for the
application environment.[P1-end] For example, in a servlet-based
application, these would be the _ServletContext_ , _HttpServletRequest_
, and _HttpServletResponse_ instances for the current request.

=== [[a516]]Create And Configure A New View

When a Faces response is being intially
created, or when the application decides it wants to create and
configure a new view that will ultimately be rendered, it may follow the
steps described below in order to set up the view that will be used. You
must start with a reference to a _FacesContext_ instance for the current
request.

=== [[a518]]Create A New View

Views are represented by a data structure
rooted in an instance of _javax.faces.component.UIViewRoot_ , and
identified by a view identifier whose meaning depends on the
_ViewHandler_ implementation to be used during the _Render Response_
phase of the request processing lifecyclelink:#a9085[3]. The
_ViewHandler_ provides a factory method that may be utilized to
construct new component trees, as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
String viewId = ... _identifier of the
desired Tree_ ...;

ViewHandler viewHandler =
application.getViewHandler();

UIViewRoot view =
viewHandler.createView(facesContext, viewId);

|===

[P1-start-createViewRoot]The _UIViewRoot_
instance returned by the _createView()_ method must minimally contain a
single _UIViewRoot_ provided by the JSF implementation, which must
encapsulate any implementation-specific component management that is
required.[P1-end] Optionally, a JSF implementation’s _ViewHandler_ may
support the automatic population of the returned _UIViewRoot_ with
additional components, perhaps based on some external metadata
description.

[P1-start-createView]The caller of
_ViewHandler.createView()_ must cause the _FacesContext_ to be populated
with the new _UIViewRoot._ Applications must make sure that it is safe
to discard any state saved in the view rooted at the _UIViewRoot_
currently stored in the _FacesContext_ .[P1-end] If Facelets is the page
definition language, _FacesContext.setViewRoot()_ must be called before
returning from _ViewHandler.createView()._ Refer to
link:JSF.html#a3910[See Default ViewHandler Implementation] for
more _ViewHandler_ details.

=== Configure the Desired RenderKit

{empty}[P1-start-defaultRenderkit]The
_UIViewRoot_ instance provided by the _ViewHandler_ , as described in
the previous subsection, must automatically be configured to utilize the
default _javax.faces.render.RenderKit_ implementation provided by the
JSF implementation, as described in link:JSF.html#a4223[See
RenderKit]. This _RenderKit_ must support the standard components and
_Renderer_ s described later in this specification, to maximize the
portability of your application.[P1-end]

However, a different _RenderKit_ instance
provided by your JSF implementation (or as an add-on library) may be
utilized instead, if desired. A reference to this _RenderKit_ instance
can be obtained from the standard _RenderKitFactory_ , and then assigned
to the _UIViewRoot_ instance created previously, as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
String renderKitId = ... identifier of
desired RenderKit ...;

RenderKitFactory rkFactory =
(RenderKitFactory)
FactoryFinder.getFactory(FactoryFinder.RENDER_KIT_FACTORY);

RenderKit renderKit =
rkFactory.getRenderKit(renderKitId, facesContext);

view.setRenderKitId(renderKitId);

|===

As described in Chapter 8, changing the
_RenderKit_ being used changes the set of _Renderer_ s that will
actually perform decoding and encoding activities. Because the
components themselves store only a _rendererType_ property (a logical
identifier of a particular _Renderer_ ), it is thus very easy to switch
between _RenderKit_ s, as long as they support renderers with the same
renderer types.

[P1-start-calcRenderkitId]The default
_ViewHandler_ must call _calculateRenderKitId()_ on itself and set the
result into the _UIViewRoot_ ’s _renderKitId_ property.[P1-end] This
allows applications that use alternative _RenderKit_ s to dynamically
switch on a per-view basis.

=== Configure The View’s Components

At any time, the application can add new
components to the view, remove them, or modify the attributes and
properties of existing components. For example, a new _FooComponent_ (an
implementation of _UIComponent_ ) can be added as a child to the root
_UIViewRoot_ in the component tree as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
FooComponent component = ... _create a
FooComponent instance_ ...;

facesContext.getViewRoot().getChildren().add(component);

|===

=== Store the new View in the FacesContext

{empty}[P1-start-setViewRoot]Once the view
has been created and configured, the _FacesContext_ instance for this
request must be made aware of it by calling _setViewRoot()_ .[P1-end]


=== Concepts that impact several lifecycle phases

This section is intended to give the reader a
“big picture” perspective on several complex concepts that impact
several request processing lifecycle phases.

=== Value Handling

At a fundamental level, JavaServer Faces is a
way to get values from the user, into your model tier for processing.
The process by which values flow from the user to the model has been
documented elsewhere in this spec, but a brief holistic survey comes in
handy. The following description assumes the JSP/HTTP case, and that all
components have Renderers.

=== Apply Request Values Phase

The user presses a button that causes a form
submit to occur. This causes the state of the form to be sent as
_name=value_ pairs in the _POST_ data of the HTTP request. The JSF
request processing lifecycle is entered, and eventually we come to the
_Apply Request Values Phase_ . In this phase, the _decode()_ method for
each _Renderer_ for each _UIComponent_ in the view is called. The
_Renderer_ takes the value from the request and passes it to the
_setSubmittedValue()_ method of the component, which is, of course, an
instance of _EditableValueHolder_ . If the component has the "
_immediate_ " property set to _true_ , we execute validation immediately
after decoding. See below for what happens when we execute validation.

=== Process Validators Phase

 _processValidators()_ is called on the root
of the view. For each _EditableValueHolder_ in the view, If the “
_immediate_ ” property is not set, we execute validation for each
_UIInput_ in the view. Otherwise, validation has already occurred and
this phase is a no-op.

=== Executing Validation

Please see the javadocs for
_UIInput.validate()_ for more details, but basically, this method gets
the submitted value from the component (set during _Apply Request
Values_ ), gets the _Renderer_ for the component and calls its
_getConvertedValue()_ , passing the submitted value. If a conversion
error occurs, it is dealt with as described in the javadocs for that
method. Otherwise, all validators attached to the component are asked to
validate the converted value. If any validation errors occur, they are
dealt with as described in the javadocs for _Validator.validate()_ . The
converted value is pushed into the component's _setValue()_ method, and
a _ValueChangeEvent_ is fired if the value has changed.

=== Update Model Values Phase

For each _UIInput_ component in the view, its
_updateModel()_ method is called. This method only takes action if a
local value was set when validation executed and if the page author
configured this component to push its value to the model tier. This
phase simply causes the converted local value of the _UIInput_ component
to be pushed to the model in the way specified by the page author. Any
errors that occur as a result of the attempt to push the value to the
model tier are dealt with as described in the javadocs for
_UIInput.updateModel()_ .

=== Localization and Internationalization (L10N/I18N)

JavaServer Faces is fully internationalized.
The I18N capability in JavaServer Faces builds on the I18N concepts
offered in the Servlet, JSP and JSTL specifications. I18N happens at
several points in the request processing lifecycle, but it is easiest to
explain what goes on by breaking the task down by function.

=== [[a554]]Determining the active _Locale_

JSF has the concept of an active _Locale_
which is used to look up all localized resources. Converters must use
this _Locale_ when performing their conversion. This _Locale_ is stored
as the value of the _locale_ JavaBeans property on the _UIViewRoot_ of
the current _FacesContext_ . The application developer can tell JSF what
locales the application supports in the applications’
_WEB-INF/faces-config.xml_ file. For example:

<faces-config>

 <application>

 <locale-config>

 <default-locale>en</default-locale>

 <supported-locale>de</supported-locale>

 <supported-locale>fr</supported-locale>

 <supported-locale>es</supported-locale>

 </locale-config>

 </application>

This application’s default locale is _en_ ,
but it also supports _de, fr,_ and _es_ locales. These elements cause
the _Application_ instance to be populated with _Locale_ data. Please
see the javadocs for details.

The _UIViewRoot_ ’s _Locale_ is determined
and set by the _ViewHandler_ during the execution of the _ViewHandler_
’s _createView()_ method. [P1-start-locale]This method must cause the
active _Locale_ to be determined by looking at the user’s preferences
combined with the application’s stated supported locales.[P1-end] Please
see the javadocs for details.

{empty}The application can call
_UIViewRoot.setLocale()_ directly, but it is also possible for the page
author to override the _UIViewRoot_ ’s locale by using the _locale_
attribute on the _<f:view_ > tag. [P1-start-localeValue]The value of
this attribute must be specified as
_language[\{-|_}country[\{-|_}variant]]_ without the colons, for example
" _ja_JP_SJIS_ ". The separators between the segments must be ' _-_ ' or
' ___ '.[P1-end]

In all cases where JSP is utilized, the
active _Locale_ is set under “request scope” into the JSTL class
_javax.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config_ , under the key _Config.FMT_LOCALE_
.

To facilitate BCP 47 support, the Locale
parsing mentioned above is done only if the JDK Locale.languageForTag
method does not return a Locale with a language in it. The additional
format of the Locale string is as specified by that method.

=== Determining the Character Encoding

The request and response character encoding
are set and interpreted as follows.

On an initial request to a Faces webapp, the
request character encoding is left unmodified, relying on the underlying
request object (e.g., the servlet or portlet request) to parse request
parameter correctly.

[P1-start-setLocale]At the beginning of the
render-response phase, the ViewHandler must ensure that the response
Locale is set to be that of the UIViewRoot, for example by calling
_ServletResponse.setLocale()_ when running in the servlet
environment.[P1-end] Setting the response Locale may affect the response
character encoding, see the Servlet and Portlet specifications for
details.

[P1-start-encoding]At the end of the
render-response phase, the ViewHandler must store the response character
encoding used by the underlying response object (e.g., the servlet or
portlet response) in the session (if and only if a session already
exists) under a well known, implementation-dependent key.

{empty}On a subsequent postback, before any
of the ExternalContext methods for accessing request parameters are
invoked, the ViewHandler must examine the Content-Type header to read
the charset attribute and use its value to set it as the request
encoding for the underlying request object. If the Content-Type header
doesn't contain a charset attribute, the encoding previously stored in
the session (if and only if a session already exists), must be used to
set the encoding for the underlying request object. If no character
encoding is found, the request encoding must be left unmodified.[P1-end]

The above algorithm allows an application to
use the mechanisms of the underlying technologies to adjust both the
request and response encoding in an application-specific manner, for
instance using the page directive with a fixed character encoding
defined in the contentType attribute in a JSP page, see the Servlet,
Portlet and JSP specifications for details. Note, though, that the
character encoding rules prior to Servlet 2.4 and JSP 2.0 are imprecise
and special care must be taken for portability between containers.

=== Localized Text

There is no direct support for this in the
API, but the JSP layer provides a convenience tag that converts a
_ResourceBundle_ into a _java.util.Map_ and stores it in the scoped
namespace so all may get to it. This section describes how resources
displayed to the end user may be localized. This includes images,
labels, button text, tooltips, alt text, etc.

Since most JSF components allow pulling their
display value from the model tier, it is easy to do the localization at
the model tier level. As a convenience, JSF provides the
_<f:loadBundle>_ tag, which takes a _ResourceBundle_ and loads it into a
_Map_ , which is then stored in the scoped namespace in request scope,
thus making its messages available using the same mechanism for
accessing data in the model tier. For example:

<f:loadBundle
basename=”com.foo.industryMessages.chemical”

 var=”messages” />

<h:outputText value=”#\{messages.benzene}” />

This must cause the _ResourceBundle_ named
_com.foo.industryMessages.chemical_ to be loaded as a Map into the
request scope under the key _messages_ . Localized content can then be
pulled out of it using the normal value expression syntax.

=== [[a584]]Localized Application Messages

This section describes how JSF handles
localized error and informational messages that occur as a result of
conversion, validation, or other application actions during the request
processing lifecycle. The JSF class
_javax.faces.application.FacesMessage_ is provided to encapsulate
summary, detail, and severity information for a message.
[P1-start-bundle]A JSF implementation must provide a
_javax.faces.Messages ResourceBundle_ containing all of the necessary
keys for the standard messages. The required keys (and a non-normative
indication of the intended message text) are as follows:

javax.faces.component.UIInput.CONVERSION --
\{0}: Conversion error occurred

javax.faces.component.UIInput.REQUIRED --
\{0}: Validation Error: Value is required

The following message keys are deprecated:

{empty}javax.faces.validator.NOT_IN_RANGE --
Specified attribute is not between the expected values of \{0} and
\{1}[P1-end]

A JSF application may provide its own
messages, or overrides to the standard messages by supplying a
_<message-bundle>_ element to in the application configuration
resources. Since the _ResourceBundle_ provided in the Java platform has
no notion of summary or detail, JSF adopts the policy that
_ResourceBundle_ key for the message looks up the message summary. The
detail is stored under the same key as the summary, with __detail_
appended. [P1-start-bundleKey]These _ResourceBundle_ keys must be used
to look up the necessary values to create a localized _FacesMessage_
instance. Note that the value of the summary and detail keys in the
_ResourceBundle_ may contain parameter substitution tokens, which must
be substituted with the appropriate values using
_java.text.MessageFormat_ .[P1-end] Replace the last parameter
substitution token shown in the messages above with the input
component’s _label_ attribute. For example, _\{1}_ for
_“DoubleRangeValidator.MAXIMUM”, \{2}_ for _“ShortConverter.SHORT”._ The
_label_ attribute is a generic attribute. Please see
_link:JSF.html#a993[See Generic Attributes]_ and
_link:JSF.html#a4314[See Standard HTML RenderKit
Implementation]_ for more information on these attributes. If the input
component’s _label_ attribute is not specified, use the component’s
client identifier.

These messages can be displayed in the page
using the _UIMessage_ and _UIMessages_ components and their
corresponding tags, _<h:message>_ and _<h:messages>._

[P1-start-facesMessage]The following
algorithm must be used to create a _FacesMessage_ instance given a
message key.

Call _getMessageBundle()_ on the
_Application_ instance for this web application, to determine if the
application has defined a resource bundle name. If so, load that
ResourceBundle and look for the message there.

If not there, look in the
_javax.faces.Messages_ resource bundle.

{empty}In either case, if a message is found,
use the above conventions to create a _FacesMessage_ instance.[P1-end]

=== State Management

JavaServer Faces introduces a powerful and
flexible system for saving and restoring the state of the view between
requests to the server. It is useful to describe state management from
several viewpoints. For the page author, state management happens
transparently. For the app assembler, state management can be configured
to save the state in the client or on the server by setting the
ServletContext InitParameter named _javax.faces.STATE_SAVING_METHOD_ to
either _client_ or _server_ . The value of this parameter directs the
state management decisions made by the implementation.

=== State Management Considerations for the Custom Component Author

Since the component developer cannot know
what the state saving method will be at runtime, they must be aware of
state management. As shown in link:JSF.html#a1834[See The
javax.faces.component package], all JSF components implement the
_StateHolder_ interface. As a consequence the standard components
provide implementations of _PartialStateHolder_ to suit their needs.
[P1-start-componentStateHolder]A custom component that extends
_UIComponent_ directly, and does not extend any of the standard
components, must implement _PartialStateHolder_ (or its older
super-interface, _StateHolder_ ), manually. The helper class
_StateHelper_ exists to simplify this process for the custom component
author. [P1-end]Please see _link:JSF.html#a1159[See
PartialStateHolder]_ or link:JSF.html#a1138[See StateHolder] for
details.

A custom component that does extend from one
of the standard components and maintains its own state, in addition to
the state maintained by the superclass must take special care to
implement _StateHolder_ or _PartialStateHolder_ correctly.
[P1-start-saveState]Notably, calls to _saveState()_ must not alter the
state in any way.[P1-end] The subclass is responsible for saving and
restoring the state of the superclass. Consider this example. My custom
component represents a “slider” ui widget. As such, it needs to keep
track of the maximum value, minimum value, and current values as part of
its state.

public class Slider extends UISelectOne \{

 protected Integer min = null;

 protected Integer max = null;

 protected Integer cur = null;



// ... details omitted

public Object saveState(FacesContext context)
\{

 Object values[] = new Object[4];

 values[0] = super.saveState(context);

 values[1] = min;

 values[2] = max;

 values[3] = cur;

}



public void restoreState(FacesContext
context, Object state) \{

 Object values[] = (Object \{}) state; //
guaranteed to succeed

 super.restoreState(context, values[0]);

 min = (Integer) values[1];

 max = (Integer) values[2];

 cur = (Integer) values[3];

}

Note that we call _super.saveState()_ and
_super.restoreState()_ as appropriate. This is absolutely vital! Failing
to do this will prevent the component from working.

=== State Management Considerations for the JSF Implementor

The intent of the state management facility
is to make life easier for the page author, app assembler, and component
author. However, the complexity has to live somewhere, and the JSF
implementor is the lucky role. Here is an overview of the key players.
Please see the javadocs for each individual class for more information.

=== Key Players in State Management

 _StateHelper_ the helper class that defines
a _Map_ -like contract that makes it easier for components to implement
_PartialStateHolder_ .

 _ViewHandler_ the entry point to the state
management system. Uses a helper class, _StateManager_ , to do the
actual work. In the JSP case, delegates to the tag handler for the
_<f:view>_ tag for some functionality.

 _StateManager_ abstraction for the hard work
of state saving. Uses a helper class, _ResponseStateManager_ , for the
rendering technology specific decisions.

 _ResponseStateManager_ abstraction for
rendering technology specific state management decisions.

 _UIComponent_ directs process of saving and
restoring individual component state.

=== [[a685]]Resource Handling

This section only applies to pages written
using Facelets for JSF 2 and later. link:JSF.html#a746[See
Resource Handling] is the starting point for the normative specification
for Resource Handling. This section gives a non-normative overview of
the feature. The following steps walk through the points in the
lifecycle where this feature is encountered. Consider a Faces web
application that contains resources that have been packaged into the
application as specified in link:JSF.html#a748[See Packaging
Resources]. Assume each page in the application includes references to
resources, specifically scripts and stylesheets. The first diagram in
this chapter is helpful in understanding this example.

Consider an initial request to the
application.

The _ViewHandler_ calls
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.buildView()_ . This ultimately causes the
_processEvent()_ method for the _javax.faces.resource.Script_ and
_javax.faces.resource.Stylesheet_ renderers (which implement
_ComponentSystemEventListener)_ to be called after each component that
declares them as their renderer is added to the view. This method is
specified to take actions that cause the resource to be rendered at the
correct part in the page based on user-specified or application
invariant rules. Here’s how it works.

Every _UIComponent_ instance in a view is
created with a call to some variant of _Application.createComponent()_ .
The specification for this method now includes some annotation
processing requirements. If the component or its renderer has an
_@ListenerFor_ or _@ListenersFor_ annotation, and the _Script_ and
_Stylesheet_ renderers must, the component or its renderer are added as
a component scoped listener for the appropriate event. In the case of
_Script_ and _Stylesheet_ renderers, they must listen for the
_PostAddToViewEvent_ .

When the _processEvent()_ method is called on
a _Script_ or _Stylesheet_ renderer, the renderer takes the specified
action to move the component to the proper point in the tree based on
what kind of resource it is, and on what hints the page author has
declared on the component in the view.

The _ViewHandler_ calls
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.renderView()_ . The view is traversed as normal
and because the components with _Script_ and _Stylesheet_ renderers have
already been reparented to the proper place in the view, the normal
renderering causes the resource to be encoded as described in
link:JSF.html#a842[See Rendering Resources].

The browser then parses the completely
rendered page and proceeds to issue subsequent requests for the
resources included in the page.

Now consider a request from the browser for
one of those resources included in the page.

The request comes back to the Faces server.
The _FacesServlet_ is specified to call
_ResourceHandler.isResourceRequest()_ as shown in the diagram in
link:JSF.html#a390[See Faces Request Generates Faces Response].
In this case, the method returns _true_ . The _FacesServlet_ is
specified to call _ResourceHandler.handleResourceRequest()_ to serve up
the bytes of the resource.

=== [[a695]]View Parameters

This section only applies to pages written
using Facelets for JSF 2 and later. The normative specification for this
feature is spread out across several places, including the View
Declaration Language Documentation for the _<f:metadata>_ element, the
javadocs for the _UIViewParameter_ , _ViewHandler_ , and
_ViewDeclarationLanguage_ classes, and the spec language requirements
for the default _NavigationHandler_ and the Request Processing
Lifecycle. This leads to a very diffuse field of specification
requirements. To aid in understanding the feature, this section provides
a non-normative overview of the feature. The following steps walk
through the points in the lifecycle where this feature is encountered.
Consider a web application that uses this feature exclusively on every
page. Therefore every page has the following features in common.

Every page has an _<f:metadata>_ tag, with at
least one _<f:viewParameter>_ element within it.

Every page has at least one _<h:link>_ or <
_h:button>_ with the appropriate parameters nested within it.

No other kind of navigation components are
used in the application.

Consider an initial request to the
application.

As specified in section
link:JSF.html#a404[See Restore View], the restore view phase of
the request processing lifecycle detects that this is an initial request
and tries to obtain the _ViewDeclarationLanguage_ instance from the
_ViewHandler_ for this _viewId_ . Because every page in the app is
written in Facelets for JSF 2.0, there is a _ViewDeclarationLanguage_
instance. Restore view phase calls
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.getViewMetadata()_ . Because every view in this
particular app does have _<f:metadata>_ on every page, this method
returns a _ViewMetadata_ instance. Restore view phase calls
_MetaData.createMetadataView()_ . This method creates a _UIViewRoot_
containing only children declared in the _<f:metadata>_ element. Restore
view phase calls _ViewMetadata.getViewParameters()_ . Because every
_<f:metadata>_ in the app has at least one _<f:viewParameter>_ element
within it, this method returns a non empty _Collection<UIViewParameter>_
. Restore view phase uses this fact to decide that the lifecycle must
not skip straight to render response, as is the normal action taken on
initial requests.

The remaining phases of the request
processing lifecycle execute: apply request values, process validations,
update model values, invoke application, and finally render response.
Because the view only contains _UIViewParameter_ children, only these
children are traversed during the lifecycle, but because this is an
initial request, with no query parameters, none of these compnents take
any action during the lifecycle.

Because the pages exclusively use _<h:link>_
and _<h:button>_ for their navigation, the renderers for these
components are called during the rendering of the page. As specified in
the renderkit docs for the renderers for those components, markup is
rendered that causes the browser to issue a GET request with query
parameters.

Consider when the user clicks on a link in
the application. The browser issues a GET request with query parameters

Restore view phase takes the same action as
in the previously explained request. Because this is a GET request, no
state is restored from the previous request.

Because this is a request with query
parameters, the _UIViewParameter_ children do take action when they are
traversed during the normal lifecycle, reading values during the apply
request values phase, doing conversion and processing validators
attached to the _<f:viewParam>_ elements, if any, and updating models
during the update model values phase. Because there are only _<h:link>_
and _<h:button>_ navigation elements in the page, no action action will
happen during the invoke application phase. The response is re-rendered
as normal. In such an application, the only navigation to a new page
happens by virtue of the browser issuing a GET request to a different
viewId.

=== [[a707]]Bookmarkability

Prior to JSF 2, every client server
interaction was an HTTP POST. While this works fine in many situations,
it does not work well when it comes to bookmarking pages in a web
application. Version 2 of the specification introduces bookmarking
capability with the use of two new Standard HTML RenderKit additions.

Provided is a new component (UIOutcomeTarget)
that provides properties that are used to produce a hyperlink at render
time. The component can appear in the form of a button or a link. This
feature introduces a concept known as “preemptive navigation”, which
means the target URL is determined at Render Response time - before the
user has activated the component. This feature allows the user to
leverage the navigation model while also providing the ability to
generate bookmarkable non-faces requests.

=== [[a710]]JSR 303 Bean Validation

{empty}Version 2 of the specification
introduces support for JSR 303 Bean Validation.
[p1-beanValidationRequired]A JSF implentation must support JSR 303 Bean
Validation if the environment in which the JSF runtime is included
requires JSR 303 Bean Validation. Currently the only such environment is
when JSF is included in a Java EE 6 runtime.[p1-end]

A detailed description of the usage of Bean
Validation with JSF is beyond the scope of this section, but this
section will provide a brief overview of the feature, touching on the
points of interest to a spec implementor. Consider a simple web
application that has one page, written in Facelets for JSF 2, that has a
several text fields inside of a form. This application is running in a
JSF runtime in an environment that does require JSR 303 Bean Validation,
and therefore this feature is available. Assume that every text field is
bound to a managed bean property that has at least one Bean Validation
constraint annotation attached to it.

During the render response phase that always
precedes a postback, due to the specification requirements in
link:JSF.html#a1419[See Validation Registration], every
_UIInput_ in this application has an instance of _Validator_ with id
_javax.faces.Bean_ attached to it.

During the process validations phase, due to
the specification for the _validate()_ method of this _Validator_ , Bean
Validation is invoked automatically, for the user specified validation
constraints, whenever such components are normally validated. The
_javax.faces.Bean_ standard validator also ensures that every
_ConstraintViolation_ that resulted in attempting to validate the model
data is wrapped in a _FacesMessage_ and added to the _FacesContext_ as
normal with every other kind of validator.

See also link:JSF.html#a1461[See Bean
Validation Integration].

=== [[a716]]Ajax

JSF and Ajax have been working well together
for a number of years. this has led to the sprouting of many JSF Ajax
frameworks. Although many of these frameworks may appear different, they
all contribute to a dynamic request response experience. The variations
in the way these frameworks provide that experience causes component
compatibility problems when using components from different libraries
together in the same web application.

JSF 2 introduces Ajax into the specification,
and it builds upon important concepts from a variety of existing JSF
Ajax frameworks. The specification introduces a JavaScript library for
performing basic Ajax operations. The library helps define a standard
way of sending an Ajax request, and processing an Ajax response, since
these are problem areas for component compatability. The specification
provides two ways of adding Ajax to JSF web applications. Page authors
may use the JavaScript library directly in their pages by attaching the
Ajax request call to a JSF component via a JavaScript event (such as
onclick). They may also take a more declarative aproach and use a core
Facelets tag (<f:ajax/>) that they can nest within JSF components to
“Ajaxify” them. It is also possible to “Ajaxify” regions of a page by
“wrapping” the tag around component groups.

The server side aspects of JSF Ajax
frameworks work with the standard JSF lifecycle. In addition to
providing a standard page authoring experience, the specification also
standardizes the server side processing of Ajax requests. Selected
components in a JSF view can be priocessed (known as partial processing)
and selected components can be rendered to the client (known as partial
rendering).

=== [[a720]]Component Behaviors

The JSF 2 specification introduces a new type
of attached object known as component behaviors. Component behaviors
play a similar role to converters and validators in that they are
attached to a component instance in order to enhance the component with
additional functionality not defined by the component itself. While
converters and validators are currently limited to the server-side
request processing lifecycle, component behaviors have impact that
extends to the client, within the scope of a particular instance
component in a view. In particular, the _ClientBehavior_ interface
defines a contract for behaviors that can enhance a component's rendered
content with behavior-defined "scripts". These scripts are executed on
the client in response to end user interaction, but can also trigger
postbacks back into the JSF request processing lifecycle.

The usage pattern for client behaviors is as
follows:

The page author attaches a client behavior to
a component, typically by specifying a behavior tag as a child of a
component tag.

When attaching a client behavior to a
component, the page author identifies the name of a client "event" to
attach to. The set of valid events are defined by the component.

At render time, the component (or renderer)
retrieves the client behavior and asks it for its script.

The component (or renderer) renders this
script at the appropriate location in its generated content (eg.
typically in a DOM event handler).

When the end user interacts with the
component's content in the browser, the behavior-defined script is
executed in response to the page author-specified event.

The script provides some client-side
interaction, for example, hiding or showing content or validating input
on the client, and possibly posts back to the server.

The first client behavior provided by the JSF
specification is the _AjaxBehavior_ . This behavior is exposed to a page
author as a Facelets _<f:ajax>_ tag, which can be embedded within any of
the standard HTML components as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
 <h:commandButton>

 <f:ajax event="mouseover"/>

 </h:commandButton>

|===

When activated in response to end user
activity, the _<f:ajax>_ client behavior generates an Ajax request back
into the JSF request processing lifecycle.

The component behavior framework is
extensible and allows developers to define custom behaviors and also
allows component authors to enhance custom components to work with
behaviors.

=== System Events

System Events are normatively specified in
link:JSF.html#a1359[See System Events]. This section provides an
overview of this feature as it relates to the lifecycle.

System events expand on the idea of lifecycle
_PhaseEvent_ s. With _PhaseEvent_ s, it is possible to have application
scoped _PhaseListeners_ that are given the opportunity to act on the
system before and after each phase in the lifecycle. System events
provide a much more fine grained insight into the system, allowing
application or component scoped listeners to be notified of a variety of
kinds of events. The set of events supported in the core specification
is given in link:JSF.html#a1361[See Event
Classes]. To accomodate extensibility, users may define their own kinds
of events.

The system event feature is a simple
publish/subscribe event model. There is no event queue, events are
published immediately, and always with a call to
_Application.publishEvent()_ . There are several ways to declare
interest in a particular kind of event.

Call _Application.subscribeToEvent()_ to add
an application scoped listener.

Call _UIComponent.subscribeToEvent()_ to add
a component scoped listener.

Use the _<f:event>_ tag to declare a
component scoped listener.

Use the _@ListenerFor_ or _@ListenersFor_
annotation. The scope of the listener is determined by the code that
processes the annotation.

Use the _<system-event-listener>_ element in
an application configuration resource to add an application scoped
listener.

This feature is conceptually related to the
lifecycle because there are calls to _Application.publishEvent()_
sprinkled throughout the code that gets executed when the lifecycle
runs.


[[a746]]
=== Resource Handling

=== As shown in the diagram in link:JSF.html#a390[See Faces Request Generates Faces Response], [P1-start isResourceRequest rules] the JSF run-time must determine if the current Faces Request is a _Faces Resource Reques_ t or a _View Request_ . This must be accomplished by calling _Application.getResourceHandler().isResourceRequest()_ . [P1-end] Most of the normative specification for resource handling is contained in the Javadocs for _ResourceHandler_ and its related classes. This section contains the specification for resource handling that fits best in prose, rather than in Javadocs.

=== [[a748]]Packaging Resources

ResourceHandler defines a path based
packaging convention for resources. The default implementation of
ResourceHandler must support packaging resources in the web application
root or in the classpath, according to the following specification.Other
implementations of ResourceHandler are free to package resources however
they like.

=== [[a750]]Packaging Resources into the Web Application Root

[P1-start web app packaging ] The default
implementation must support packaging resources in the web application
root under the path

 _resources/<resourceIdentifier_ >

relative to the web app root. Resources
packaged into the web app root must be accessed using the
_getResource*()_ methods on _ExternalContext._ [P1-end] __

=== [[a754]]Packaging Resources into the Classpath

[P1-start classpath packaging ]For the
default implementation, resources packaged in the classpath must reside
under the JAR entry name:

 _META-INF/resources/<resourceIdentifier>_

{empty}Resources packaged into the classpath
must be accessed using the _getResource*()_ methods of the _ClassLoader_
obtained by calling the _getContextClassLoader()_ method of the curreth
_Thread_ .[P1-end]

=== [[a758]]Resource Identifiers

 _<resourceIdentifier>_ consists of several
segments, specified as follows.

{empty}[P1-start requirements for something
to be considered a valid resourceIdentifier]


_[localePrefix/][libraryName/][libraryVersion/]resourceName[/resourceVersion]_

The run-time must enforce the following rules
to consider a _<resourceIdentifier>_ valid. A _<resourceIdentifier>_
that does not follow these rules must not be considered valid and must
be ignored silently.

The set of characters that are valid for use
in the _localePrefix_ , _libraryName_ , _libraryVerison_ ,
_resourceName_ and _resourceVersion_ segments of the resource identifier
is specififed as XML NameChar excluding the path separator and ‘:’
characters. The specification for XML NameChar may be seen at
_http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#NT-NameChar_ .

A further restriction applies to
_libraryName_ . A _libraryName_ must not be an underscore separated
sequence of non-negative integers or a locale string. More rigorously, a
_libraryName_ must not match either of the following regular
expressions:

 _[0-9]+(_[0-9]+)*_

 _[A-Za-z]\{2}(_[A-Za-z]\{2}(_[A-Za-z]+)*)?_

Segments in square brackets [] are optional.

The segments must appear in the order shown
above.

If _libraryVersion_ is present, it must be
preceded by _libraryName._

If _libraryVersion_ is present, any leaf
files under _libraryName_ must be ignored. __

If _resourceVersion_ is present, it must be
preceded by _resourceName._

There must be a ’ _/_ ’ between adjacent
segments in a _<resourceIdentifier>_

If _libraryVersion_ or _resourceVersion_ are
present, both must be a ’ ___ ’ separated list of integers, neither
starting nor ending with ’ ___ ’

If _resourceVersion_ is present, it must be a
version number in the same format as _libraryVersion_ . An optional
“file extension” may be used with the _resourceVersion._ If “file
extension” is used, a “.” character, followed by a “file extension” must
be appended to the version number. See the following table for an
example.

{empty}[P1-end]

The following examples illustrate the nine
valid combinations of the above resource identifier segments.

=== [[a836]]Libraries of Localized and Versioned Resources

An important feature of the resource handler
is the ability for resources to be localized, versioned, and collected
into libraries. The localization and versioning scheme is completely
hidden behind the API of _ResourceHandler_ and _Resource_ and is not
exposed in any way to the JSF run-time.

[P1-start resource versioning] The default
implementation of _ResourceHandler.createResource()_ , for all variants
of that method, must implement the following to discover which actual
resource will be encapsulated within the returned _Resource_ instance.
An implementation may perform caching of the resource metadata to
improve performance if the _ProjectStage_ is _ProjectStage.Production_ .

Using the _resourceName_ and _libraryName_
arguments to _createResource()_ , and the resource packaging scheme
specified in link:JSF.html#a750[See Packaging Resources into
the Web Application Root], link:JSF.html#a754[See Packaging
Resources into the Classpath], and link:JSF.html#a758[See
Resource Identifiers], discover the file or entry that contains the
bytes of the resource. If there are multiple versions of the same
library, and _libraryVersion_ is not specified, the library with the
highest version is chosen. If there are multiple versions of the same
resource, and _resourceVersion_ is not specified, the resource with the
highest version is chosen. The algorithm is specified in pseudocode.

=== [[a842]]Rendering Resources

Resources such as images, stylesheets and
scripts use the resource handling mechanism as outlined in
link:JSF.html#a748[See Packaging Resources]. So, for example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:graphicImage name=”Planets.gif”
library=”images”/>

<h:graphicImage
value=”#\{resource[‘images:Planets.gif’]}”/>

|===

These entries render exactly the same markup.
In addition to using the name and library attributes, stylesheet and
script resources can be “relocated” to other parts of the view. For
example, we could specify that a script resource be rendered within an
HTML “head”, “body” or “form” element in the page.

=== [[a847]]Relocatable Resources

Relocatable resources are resources that can
be told where to render themselves, and this rendered location may be
different than the resource tag placement in the view. For example, a
portion of the view may be described in the view declaration language as
follows:

<f:view contentType="text/html">

<h:head>

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type"
content="text/html;

charset=iso-8859-1" />

<title>Example View</title>

</h:head>

<h:body>

<h:form>

<h:outputScript name=”ajax.js”
library=”javax.faces”

target=”head”/>

</h:form>

</h:body>

</f:view>

The <h:outputScript> tag refers to the
renderer, ScriptRenderer, that listens for PostAddToViewEvent event
types:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
@ListenerFor(facesEventClass=PostAddToViewEvent.class,

sourceClass=UIOutput.class)

public class ScriptRenderer extends Renderer
implements ComponentSystemEventListener \{...

|===

Refer to link:JSF.html#a1300[See
Event and Listener Model]. When the component for this resource is added
to the view, the ScriptRenderer processEvent method adds the component
to a facet (named by the target attribute) under the view root. using
the UIViewRoot component resource methods as described in
link:JSF.html#a2257[See Methods].

The <h:head> and <h:body> tags refer to the
renderers HeadRenderer and BodyRenderer respectively. They are described
in the Standard HTML Renderkit documentation referred to in
link:JSF.html#a4314[See Standard HTML RenderKit Implementation].
During the rendering phase, the encode methods for these renderers
render the HTML “head” and “body” elements respectively. Then they
render all component resources under the facet child (named by target)
under the UIViewRoot using the UIViewRoot component resource methods as
described in link:JSF.html#a2257[See Methods].

Existing component libraries (with existing
head and body components), that want to use this resource loading
feature must follow the rendering requirements described in
link:JSF.html#a4314[See Standard HTML RenderKit Implementation].

=== [[a869]]Resource Rendering Using Annotations

Components and renderers may be declared as
requiring a resource using the @ResourceDependency annotation. The
implementation must scan for the presence of this annotation on the
component that was added to the List of child components. Check for the
presence of the annotation on the renderer for this component (if there
is a renderer for the component). The annotation check must be done
immediately after the component is added to the List. Refer to
link:JSF.html#a937[See Component Tree Manipulation]for detailed
information.

=== Resource Library Contracts

[P1-start_contract_packaging]A resource
library contract is a resource library, as specified in the preceding
section, except that instead of residing in the _resources_ directory of
the web-app root, or in the _META-INF/resources_ JAR entry name in a JAR
file, it resides in the _contracts_ directory of the web-app root, or in
the _META-INF/contracts_ JAR entry name in a JAR file. When packaged in
a JAR file, there is one additional packaging requirement: each resource
library contract in the JAR must have a marker file. The name of the
file is given by the value of the symbolic constant
_javax.faces.application.ResourceHandler.RESOURCE_CONTRACT_XML_ . This
may be a zero length file, though future versions of the specification
may use the file to declare the usage contract. [P1-end] The requirement
to have a marker file enables implementations to optimize for faster
deployment while still enabling automatic discovery of the available
contracts.

Following is a listing of the entries in a
JAR file containing two resource library contracts.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
META-INF/contracts/ +
siteLayout/ +
javax.faces.contract.xml +
topNav_template.xhtml +
leftNav_foo.xhtml +
styles.css +
script.js +
background.png

 subSiteLayout/ +
javax.faces.contract.xml +
sub_template.xhtml



|===



All of the other packaging, encoding and
decoding requirements are the same as for resource libraries.

See link:JSF.html#a5526[See Resource
Library Contracts Background] for a non-normative overview of the
feature, including a brief usage example.

== Integration with JSP

Any Jakarta Server Faces implementations that
claims compliance with this specification must include a complete
Jakarta Server Pages implementation, and expose this implementation to the
runtime of any JSF application. JSF applications, however, need not use
JSP as their View Declaration Language (VDL). In fact, a JSF application
is free to use whatever technology it likes for its VDL, as long as that
VDL itself complies with the JSF specification.

This version of the specification requires
that implementations support two View Declaration Language syntaxes

JSP

Facelets XHTML

This chapter describes the JSP support
required by Jakarta Server Faces. This JSP support is enabled by providing
custom actions so that a JSF user interface can be easy defined in a JSP
page by adding tags corresponding to JSF UI components. Custom actions
provided by a JSF implementation may be mixed with standard JSP actions
and custom actions from other libraries, as well as template text for
layout, in the same JSP page.

Facelets XHTML is specified in
<<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5476,See Facelets and its use in Web
Applications>>. This chapters builds on the previous one. Facelets relies
on concepts specified in JSP.

For JSP version 2.0 and onward, the file
extension “ _.jsf_ ” is reserved, and may optionally be used (typically
by authoring tools) to represent VDL pages containing JSF
content <<Footnotes.adoc#a9096,13>>. When running in a JSP 1.2 environment,
JSP authors must give their JSP pages that contain JSF content a
filename ending in “ _.jsp_ ”.

=== UIComponent Custom Actions

A JSP custom action (aka custom tag or tag)
for a JSF _UIComponent_ is constructed by combining properties and
attributes of a Java UI component class with the rendering attributes
supported by a specific _Renderer_ from a concrete _RenderKit_ . For
example, assume the existence of a concrete _RenderKit_ ,
_HTMLRenderKit_ , which supports three _Renderer_ types for the
_UIInput_ component:

=== Example Renderer Types

RendererType

Render-Dependent Attributes

“Text”

“size”

“Secret”

“size”, “secretChar”

“Textarea”

“size”, “rows”

The tag library descriptor (TLD) file for the
corresponding tag library, then, would define three custom actions—one
per _Renderer_ . Below is an example of a portion of the custom action
definition for the _inputText_ tag <<Footnotes.adoc#a9097,14>>:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<tag>

 <name>inputText</name>


<tag-class>acme.html.tags.InputTag</tag-class>

 <bodycontent>JSP</bodycontent>

 <attribute>

 <name>id</name>

 <required>false</required>

 <rtexprvalue>true</rtexprvalue>

 </attribute>

 <attribute>

 <name>value</name>

 <required>false</required>

 <deferred-value>

 <type>java.lang.Object</type>

 <deferred-value>

 </attribute>

 <attribute>

 <name>size</name>

 <required>false</required>

 <deferred-value>

 <type>java.lang.Integer</type>

 <deferred-value>

 </attribute>

 ...

</tag>

|===

Note that the _size_ attribute is derived
from the _Renderer_ of type “Text”, while the _id_ and _value_
attributes are derived from the _UIInput_ component class itself. Also
note that the _id_ attribute has _rtexprvalue_ set to _true_ . This is
to allow _$\{}_ expressions in the _id_ attribute so that _<c:forEach>_
can include faces components that incorporate the index into their id.
_RenderKit_ implementors will generally provide a JSP tag library which
includes component custom actions corresponding to each of the component
classes (or types) supported by each of the _RenderKit_ ’s _Renderers_ .
See <<RenderingModel.adoc#a4223,See RenderKit>> and
<<RenderingModel.adoc#a4245,See Renderer>> for details on the
_RenderKit_ and _Renderer_ APIs. JSF implementations must provide such a
tag library for the standard HTML RenderKit (see
<<IntegrationWithJSP.adoc#a5363,See Standard HTML RenderKit Tag Library>>).


=== Using UIComponent Custom Actions in JSP Pages

The following subsections define how a page
author utilizes the custom actions provided by the _RenderKit_
implementor in the JSP pages that create the user interface of a
JSF-based web application.

=== Declaring the Tag Libraries

This specification hereby reserves the
following Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) values to refer to the
standard tag libraries for the custom actions defined by Jakarta Server
Faces:

 _http://java.sun.com/jsf/core_ -- URI for
the _Jakarta Server Faces Core Tag Library_

 _http://java.sun.com/jsf/html_ -- URI for
the _Jakarta Server Faces Standard HTML RenderKit Tag Library_

The page author must use the standard JSP
_taglib_ directive to declare the URI of each tag library to be
utilized, as well as the prefix used (within this page) to identify
custom actions from this library. For example,

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<%@ taglib uri=”http://java.sun.com/jsf/core”
prefix=”f” %>

<%@ taglib uri=”http://java.sun.com/jsf/html”
prefix=”h” %>

|===

declares the unique resource identifiers of
the tag libraries being used, as well as the prefixes to be used within
the current page for referencing actions from these
libraries <<Footnotes.adoc#a9098,15>>.

=== Including Components in a Page

A JSF _UIComponent_ custom action can be
placed at any desired position in a JSP page that contains the _taglib_
directive for the corresponding tag library, subject to the following
restrictions:

When using a single JSP page to create the
entire view, JSF component custom actions must be nested inside the
_<f:view>_ custom action from the JSF Core Tag Library.

The following example illustrates the general
use of a UIComponent custom action in a JSP page. In this scenario:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<h:inputText id=”username”
value=”#\{logonBean.username}”/>
|===

represents a _UIInput_ field, to be rendered
with the “Text” renderer type, and points to the username property of a
backing bean for the actual value. The _id_ attribute specifies the
component id of a _UIComponent_ instance, from within the component
tree, to which this custom action corresponds. If no _id_ __ is
specified, one will be automatically generated by the custom action
implementation.

Custom actions that correspond to JSF
_UIComponent_ instances must subclass
_jakarta.faces.webapp.UIComponentELTag_ (see
<<UsingJSFInWebApplications.adoc#a6175,See UIComponentELTag>>)

During the _Render Response_ phase of the
request processing lifecycle, the appropriate encoding methods of the
component (or its associated _Renderer_ ) will be utilized to generate
the representation of this component in the response page. In addition,
the first time a particular page is rendered, the component tree may
also be dynamically constructed.

All markup other than _UIComponent_ custom
actions is processed by the JSP container, in the usual way. Therefore,
you can use such markup to perform layout control, or include non-JSF
content, in conjunction with the actions that represent UI components.

=== Creating Components and Overriding Attributes

As _UIComponent_ custom actions are
encountered during the processing of a JSP page, the custom action
implementation must check the component tree for the existence of a
corresponding _UIComponent_ , and (if not found) create and configure a
new component instance corresponding to this custom action. The details
of this process (as implemented in the findComponent() method of
UIComponentClassicTagBase, for easy reuse) are as follows:

If the component associated with this
component custom action has been identified already, return it
unchanged.

Identify the _component identifier_ for the
component related to this UIComponent custom action, as follows:

If the page author has specified a value for
the _id_ attribute, use that value.

Otherwise, call the _createUniqueId()_ method
of the _UIViewRoot_ at the root of the component tree for this view, and
use that value.

If this _UIComponent_ custom action is
creating a _facet_ (that is, we are nested inside an _<f:facet>_ custom
action), determine if there is a facet of the component associated with
our parent _UIComponent_ custom action, with the specified facet name,
and proceed as follows:

If such a facet already exists, take no
additional action.

If no such facet already exists, create a new
_UIComponent_ (by calling the _createComponent()_ method on the
_Application_ instance for this web application, passing the value
returned by _getComponentType()_ , set the component identifier to the
specified value, call _setProperties()_ passing the new component
instance, and add the new component as a facet of the component
associated with our parent _UIComponent_ custom action, under the
specified facet name.

If this _UIComponent_ custom action is not
creating a facet (that is, we are not nested inside an _<f:facet>_
custom action), determine if there is a child component of the component
associated with our parent _UIComponent_ custom action, with the
specified component identifier, and proceed as follows:

If such a child already exists, take no
additional action.

If no such child already exists, create a new
_UIComponent_ (by calling the _createComponent()_ method on the
_Application_ instance for this web application, passing the value
returned by _getComponentType()_ , set the component identifier to the
specified value, call _setProperties()_ passing the new component
instance, and add the new component as a child of the component
associated with our parent _UIComponent_ custom action.

=== Deleting Components on Redisplay

In addition to the support for dynamically
creating new components, as described above, UIComponent custom actions
will also _delete_ child components (and facets) that are already
present in the component tree, but are not rendered on this display of
the page. For example, consider a UIComponent custom action that is
nested inside a JSTL _<c:if>_ custom action whose condition is true when
the page is initially rendered. As described in this section, a new
UIComponent will have been created and added as a child of the
_UIComponent_ corresponding to our parent _UIComponent_ custom action.
If the page is re-rendered, but this time the _<c:if>_ condition is
_false_ , the previous child component will be removed.

=== Representing Component Hierarchies

Nested structures of _UIComponent_ custom
actions will generally mirror the hierarchical relationships of the
corresponding _UIComponent_ instances in the view that is associated
with each JSP page. For example, assume that a _UIForm_ component (whose
component id is _logonForm_ ) contains a _UIPanel_ component used to
manage the layout. You might specify the contents of the form like this:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:form id=”logonForm”>

 <h:panelGrid columns=”2”>

 <h:outputLabel for=”username”>

 <h:outputText value=”Username:”/>

 </h:outputLabel>

 <h:inputText id=”username”

 value=”#\{logonBean.username}”/>

 <h:outputLabel for=”password”>

 <h:outputText value=”Password:”/>

 </h:outputLabel>

 <h:inputSecret id=”password”

 value=”#\{logonBean.password}”/>

 <h:commandButton id=”submitButton”
type=”SUBMIT”

 action=”#\{logonBean.logon}”/>

 <h:commandButton id=”resetButton”
type=”RESET”/>

 </h:panelGrid>

</h:form>

|===

=== Registering Converters, Event Listeners, and Validators

Each JSF implementation is required to
provide the core tag library (see <<IntegrationWithJSP.adoc#a4636,See JSF
Core Tag Library>>), which includes custom actions that (when executed)
create instances of a specified _Converter_ , _ValueChangeListener,_
_ActionListener_ or _Validator_ implementation class, and register the
created instance with the _UIComponent_ associated with the most
immediately surrounding _UIComponent_ custom action.

Using these facilities, the page author can
manage all aspects of creating and configuring values associated with
the view, without having to resort to Java code. For example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:inputText id=”username”
value=”#\{logonBean.username}”>

 <f:validateLength minimum=”6”/>

</h:inputText>

|===

associates a validation check (that the value
entered by the user must contain at least six characters) with the
username _UIInput_ component being described.

Following are usage examples for the
_valueChangeListener_ and _actionListener_ custom actions.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:inputText id=”maxUsers”>

 <f:convertNumber integerOnly=”true”/>

 <f:valueChangeListener

 type="custom.MyValueChangeListener"/>

</h:inputText>

<h:commandButton label="Login">

 <f:actionListener
type="custom.MyActionListener"/>

</h:commandButton>

|===

This example causes a _Converter_ and a
_ValueChangeListener_ of the user specified type to be instantiated and
added as to the enclosing _UIInput_ component, and an _ActionListener_
is instantiated and added to the enclosing _UICommand_ component. If the
user specified type does not implement the proper listener interface a
_JSPException_ must be thrown.

=== Using Facets

A _Facet_ is a subordinate UIComponent that
has a special relationship to its parent _UIComponent_ , as described in
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a968,See Facet Management>>. Facets can be defined
in a JSP page using the _<f:facet>_ custom action. Each facet action
must have one and only one child UIComponent custom
action <<Footnotes.adoc#a9099,16>>. For example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:dataTable ...>

 <f:facet name=”header”>

 <h:outputText value=”Customer List”/>

 </f:facet>

 <h:column>

 <f:facet name=”header”>

 <h:outputText value=”Account Id”/>

 </f:facet>

 <h:outputText id=”accountId” value=
”#\{customer.accountId}”/>

 </h:column>

 ...

</h:dataTable>

|===

[[a4536]]
=== Interoperability with JSP Template Text and Other Tag Libraries

It is permissible to use other tag libraries,
such as the JSP Standard Tag Library (JSTL) in the same JSP page with
_UIComponent_ custom actions that correspond to JSF components, subject
to certain restrictions. When JSF component actions are nested inside
custom actions from other libraries, or combined with template text, the
following behaviors must be supported:

JSF component custom actions nested inside a
custom action that conditionally renders its body (such as JSTL’s
_<c:if>_ or _<c:choose>_ ) must contain a manually assigned _id_
attribute.

Interoperation with the JSTL
Internationalization-Capable Formatting library (typically used with the
“ _fmt_ ” prefix) is restricted as follows:

The _<fmt:parseDate>_ and
_<fmt:parseNumber>_ custom actions should not be used. The corresponding
JSF facility is to use an _<h:inputText>_ component custom action with
an appropriate _DateTimeConverter_ or _NumberConverter_ .

The _<fmt:requestEncoding>_ custom action
should not be used. By the time it is executed, the request parameters
will have already been parsed, so any change in the setting here will
have no impact. JSF handles character set issues automatically in most
cases. To use a fixed character set in exceptional circumstances, use
the a “ _<%@ page contentType=”[content-type];[charset]” %>_ ”
directive.

The _<fmt:setLocale/>_ custom action should
not be used. Even though it might work in some circumstances, it would
result in JSF and JSTL assuming different locales. If the two locales
use different character sets, the results will be undefined.
Applications should use JSF facilities for setting the _locale_ property
on the _UIViewRoot_ component to change locales for a particular user.

=== Composing Pages from Multiple Sources

JSP pages can be composed from multiple
sources using several mechanisms:

The _<%@include%>_ directive performs a
compile-time inclusion of a specified source file into the page being
compiled <<Footnotes.adoc#a9100,17>>. From the perspective of JSF, such
inclusions are transparent—the page is compiled as if the inclusions had
been performed before compilation was initiated.

Several mechanisms (including the
_<jsp:include>_ standard action, the JSTL _<c:import>_ custom action
when referencing a resource in the same webapp, and a call to
_RequestDispatcher.include()_ for a resource in the same webapp) perform
a runtime dynamic inclusion of the results of including the response
content of the requested page resource in place of the include action.
Any JSF components created by execution of JSF component custom actions
in the included resource will be grafted onto the component tree, just
as if the source text of the included page had appeared in the calling
page at the position of the include action.

For mechanisms that aggregate content by
other means (such as use of an _HttpURLConnection_ , a
_RequestDispatcher.include()_ on a resource from a different web
application, or accessing an external resource with the JSTL
_<c:import>_ custom action on a resource from a different web
application, only the response content of the aggregation request is
available. Therefore, any use of JSF components in the generation of
such a response are not combined with the component tree for the current
page.


[[a4549]]
=== UIComponent Custom Action Implementation Requirements

The custom action implementation classes for
_UIComponent_ custom actions must conform to all of the requirements
defined in the Jakarta Server Pages Specification. In addition, they must
meet the following JSF-specific requirements:

Extend the _UIComponentELTag_ or
_UIComponentELBodyTag_ base class, so that JSF implementations can
recognize _UIComponent_ custom actions versus others.

Provide a public _getComponentType()_ method
that returns a String-valued component type registered with the
_Application_ instance for this web application. The value returned by
this method will be passed to _Application.createComponent()_ when a new
_UIComponent_ instance associated with this custom action is to be
created.

Provide a public _getRendererType()_ method
that returns a String-valued renderer type registered with the
_RenderKit_ instance for the currently selected _RenderKit,_ or _null_
if there should be no associated _Renderer_ . The value returned by this
method will be used to set the _rendererType_ property of any
UIComponent created by this custom action.

Provide setter methods taking a
_jakarta.el.ValueExpression_ or _jakarta.el.MethodExpression_ parameter for
all set-able (from a custom action) properties of the corresponding
_UIComponent_ class, and all additional set-able (from a custom action)
attributes supported by the corresponding _Renderer_ .

On the method that causes a _UIComponent_
instance to be added to the tree, verify that the component id of that
_UIComponent_ is unique within the scope of the closest ancestor
component that is a _NamingContainer_ . If this constraint is not met,
throw _JspException_ . __

Provide a protected _setProperties()_ method
of type _void_ that takes a _UIComponent_ instance as parameter. The
implementation of this method must perform the following tasks:

Call _super.setProperties()_ , passing the
same _UIComponent_ instance received as a parameter.

For each non-null custom action attribute
that corresponds to a property based attribute to be set on the
underlying component, call either _setValueExpression()_ or
_getAttributes().put()_ , depending on whether or not a value expression
was specified as the custom action attribute value (performing any
required type conversion). For example, assume that title is the name of
a render-dependent attribute for this component:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void setTitle(jakarta.el.ValueExpression
title) \{

 this.title = title;

}



protected void setProperties(UIComponent
component) throws JspException \{

 super.setProperties(component);

 if (title != null) \{

 try \{

 component.setValueExpression(“title”,
title);

 }

 catch (ELException e) \{

 throw new JspException(e);

 }

 ...

}

|===

For each non-null custom action attribute
that corresponds to a method based attribute to be set on the underlying
component, the value of the attribute must be a method reference
expression. We have a number of wrapper classes to turn a
MethodExpression into the appropriate listener. For example, assume that
_valueChangeListener_ is the name of an attribute for this component:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void
setValueChangeListener(jakarta.el.MethodExpression me) \{

 valueChangeListener = me;

}



protected void setProperties(UIComponent
component) \{

 super.setProperties(component);

 MethodExpressionValueChangeListener listener
=

 new
MethodExpressionValueChangeListener(valueChangeListener);

 input.addValueChangeListener(listener);

 ...

}

|===

Non-null custom action attributes that
correspond to a writable property to be set on the underlying component
are handled in a similar fashion. For example, assume a custom action
for the _UIData_ component is being created that needs to deal with the
_rows_ property (which is of type _int_ ):

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void setRows(jakarta.el.ValueExpression
rows) \{

 this.rows = rows;

}



protected void setProperties(UIComponent
component) \{

 super.setProperties(component);

 if (rows != null) \{

 try \{

 component.setValueExpression(“rows”, rows);

 } catch (ELException e) \{

 throw new JspException(e);

 }

 }

 ...

}

|===

Optionally, provide a public _release()_
method of type _void_ , taking no parameters, to be called when the JSP
page handler releases this custom action instance. If implemented, the
method must perform the following tasks:

Call _super.release()_ to invoke the
superclass’s release functionality.

Clear the instance variables representing the
values for set-able custom action attributes (for example, by setting
String values to null).

Optionally provide overridden implementations
for the following method to fine tune the behavior of your _UIComponent_
custom action implementation class: _encodeComponent()_ .

It is technically possible to override other
public and protected methods of the _UIComponentELTag_ or
_UIComponentBodyELTag_ base class; however, it is likely that overriding
these methods will interfere with the functionality that other portions
of the JSF implementation are assuming to be present, so overriding
these methods is strongly discouraged.

The definition of each _UIComponent_ custom
action in the corresponding tag library descriptor (TLD) must conform to
the following requirements:

The _<body-content>_ element for the custom
action itself must specify _JSP_ .

For each attribute that is intended to be
passed on to the underlying faces component:

The attribute may not be named _id_ . This
name is reserved for Faces use.

If the attribute represents a method
expression, it must have a _<deferred-method>_ element containing a
_<method-signature>_ element that describes the signature of the method
pointed to by the expression, as described in section JSP.C.1 in the JSP
2.1 specification.

Otherwise, the attribute must be a value
based attribute, and must have a _<deferred-value>_ element containing a
<type> element which describes the expected type to which the expression
will evaluate. Please see section JSP.C.1 in the JSP 2.1 specification
for details.

=== Considerations for Custom Actions written for Jakarta Server Faces 1.1 and 1.0

Versions 1.0 and 1.1 of the Jakarta Server Faces
spec included their own EL that happend to have similar semantics to the
JSP EL, but the implementation was bundled into the Faces
implementation. This version leverages a new Unified EL facility
provided by JSP. This change has necessitated deprecating some methods
and classes, including the classes Custom Actions as their base class
for tags that expose Faces components to the JSP page. This section
explains how custom actions built for Faces 1.0 and 1.1 can continue to
run Faces 1.2.

=== Past and Present Tag constraints

Faces 1.0 and 1.1 were targeted at JSP
version 1.2 and Servlet version 2.3. This decision brought about several
constraints for faces tag attributes:

all tag attributes had to declare
_rtexprvalue_ to be _false._

all tag attributes had to take the type
_java.lang.String_ .

Faces had to choose a new expression
delimiter, _#\{}_ , to prevent the JSP container from prematurely
evaluating the expression. This became known as deferred evaluation.

Because Faces had introduced its own version
of the EL, the custom tag action layer had to do a lot of extra work to
“value binding enable” its attributes, calling Faces EL APIs to turn the
String attribute value into an instance of _ValueBinding_ or
_MethodBinding_ .

Faces provided the _UIComponentTag_ and
_UIComponentBodyTag_ base classes that were designed to adhere to the
above rules.

Tags that use the Unified EL have the
following constraints:

all tag attributes must not have an
_rtexprvalue_ attribute

all tag attributes must accept
_jakarta.el.ValueExpression_ or _jakarta.el.MethodExpression_ as their type
(depending on if the attribute refers to a method or a value).

all tag attributes (except for _id_ ) must
have a _<deferred-value>_ or _<deferred-method>_ element. See
_<<IntegrationWithJSP.adoc#a4636,See JSF Core Tag Library>>_ in the
description for the _Attributes_ column.

The JSP Container will hand the tag setter a
_jakarta.el.ValueExpression_ or _jakarta.el.MethodExpression_ directly, so
there is no need to use the Faces API to create them.

The _UIComponentTag_ and _UIComponentBodyTag_
classes are deprecated and Faces provides new base class,
UIComponentELTag to the new rules for taglibs in Faces.

It’s very important to note that we still are
using #\{} as the delimiters for expressions that appear in a JSP page
in the value of a tag attribute, but when the Java API is used, either
$\{} or #\{} may be used for delimiters.

[[a4629]]
=== Faces 1.0 and 1.1 Taglib migration story

It is imperative that applications written
for Faces 1.0 and 1.1 continue to run on Faces 1.2. From the JSP
perspective, this means

that JSP pages using the standard h: and f:
tags must work without change

that JSP pages using custom faces taglibs
must work without change

The first item is enabled by re-writing the
h: and f: taglibs which must be provided by the Faces implementor.

The second item is enabled as follows. For
discussion the term _jsp-version_ is used to denote the _jsp-version_
element in a JSP 1.2 (and earlier) TLD, as well as the _version_ element
in a JSP 2.0 (and later) TLD. The JSP container must examine the
_jsp-version_ element of the TLD for a taglib. If the _jsp-version_ is
less than 2.1, the taglib is deemed to be a Faces 1.0 or 1.1 taglib and
the container must ignore all expressions that use #\{} as delimiters,
except for those appearing in tag attribute with a property setter that
takes a _jakarta.el.ValueExpression_ or _jakarta.el.MethodExpression_ . If
the _jsp-version_ is 2.1 or greater, the taglib is deemed to be a Faces
1.2 or later taglib and the JSP container is aware of #\{} expressions.


[[a4636]]
=== JSF Core Tag Library

[P1-start jsf_core taglib requirements] All
JSF implementations must provide a tag library containing core actions
(described below) that are independent of a particular _RenderKit_ . The
corresponding tag library descriptor must meet the following
requirements:

Must declare a tag library version (
_<tlib-version>_ ) value of _1.2_ .

Must declare a URI ( _<uri>_ ) value of
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/core_ .

{empty}Must be included in the _META-INF_
directory of a JAR file containing the corresponding implementation
classes, suitable for inclusion with a web application, such that the
tag library descriptor will be located automatically by the algorithm
described in Section 7.3 of the _Jakarta Server Pages Specification_
(version 2.1). [P1-end]

{empty}[P1-start no javascript in jsf_core
taglib] The tags in the implementation of this tag library must not
cause JavaScript to be rendered to the client. Doing so would break the
requirement that the JSF Core Tag library is independent of any specific
RenderKit. [P1-end]

Each custom action included in the JSF Core
Tag Library is documented in a subsection below, with the following
outline for each action:

Name—The name of this custom action, as used
in a JSP page.

Short Description—A summary of the behavior
implemented by this custom action.

Syntax—One or more examples of using this
custom action, with the required and optional sets of attributes that
may be used together. If the tag may have an _id_ attribute, its value
may be a literal string, or an immediate, non-defferd expression, such
as “ _userName_ ” or “ _user$\{i}_ ” without the quotes.

Body Content—The type of nested content for
this custom action, using one of the standard values _empty_ , _JSP_ ,
or _tagdependent_ as described in the JSP specification. This section
also describes restrictions on the types of content (template text, JSF
core custom actions, JSF _UIComponent_ custom actions, and/or other
custom actions) that can be nested in the body of this custom action.

Attributes—A table containing one row for
each defined attribute for this custom action. The following columns
provide descriptive information about each attribute:

Name—Name of this attribute, as it must be
used in the page. If the name of the attribute is in _italics_ , it is
required.

Expr—The type of dynamic expression (if any)
that can be used in this attribute value. Legal values are VE (this may
be a literal or a value expression), ME (this may be a method
expression), or NONE (this attribute accepts literal values only). If
the _Expr_ column is VE, the corresponding _<attribute>_ declaration in
the TLD must contain a _<deferred-value>_ element, optionally containing
a _<type>_ element that contains the fully qualified java class name of
the expected type of the expression. If _<type>_ is omitted,
Object.class is assumed. If the _Expr_ column is ME, the corresponding
_<attribute>_ declaration in the TLD must contain a _<deferred-method>_
element, containing a _<method-signature>_ element that describes the
exact method signature for the method. In this case, the _Description_
column the description column contains the method signature.

=== <f:actionListener>

Register an _ActionListener_ instance on the
_UIComponent_ associated with the closest parent _UIComponent_ custom
action.

=== Syntax

<f:actionListener
type=”fully-qualified-classname” binding=”value Expression”/>

=== Body Content

empty.

|Name |Expr
|Type |Description
| _type_ | _VE_
| _String_ |Fully
qualified Java class name of an _ActionListener_ to be created and
registered

|binding | _VE_
| _ValueExpression_
|A _ValueExpression_ expression that
evaluates to an object that implements
_jakarta.faces.event.ActionListener_
|===

=== Constraints

Must be nested inside a _UIComponent_ custom
action.

The corresponding _UIComponent_
implementation class must implement _ActionSource_ , and therefore
define a public _addActionListener()_ method that accepts an
_ActionListener_ parameter.

The specified listener class must implement
_jakarta.faces.event.ActionListener_ .

_type_ and/or binding must be specified.

[P1-start f:actionListener constraints] If
this tag is not nested inside a _UIComponent_ custom action, or the
_UIComponent_ implementation class does not correctly implement
_ActionSource_ , or the specified listener class does not implement
_jakarta.faces.event.ActionListener_ , throw a _JspException_ . [P1-end]
Note that if the binding attribute is used, the scope of the
_ValueExpression_ must be chosen carefully so as not to introduce
undesireable results. In general, when using the binding attribute, do
not point to beans in request or narrower scope.

=== Description

Locate the closest parent _UIComponent_
custom action instance by calling
_UIComponentClassicTagBase.getParentUIComponentClassicTagBase()_ . If
the _getCreated()_ method of this instance returns _true,_ check the
binding attribute.

If binding is set, create a _ValueExpression_
by invoking _Application.createValueExpression_ () with binding as the
expression argument, and _Object.class_ as the expectedType argument.
Use the _ValueExpression_ to obtain a reference to the _ActionListener_
instance. If there is no exception thrown, and
_ValueExpression.getValue()_ returned a non-null object that implements
_jakarta.faces.event.ActionListener_ , register it by calling
_addActionListener()._ If there was an exception thrown, rethrow the
exception as a _JspException._

If the listener instance could not be
created, check the _type_ attribute _._ If the _type_ attribute is set,
instantiate an instance of the specified class, and register it by
calling _addActionListener()_ . If the binding attribute was also set,
evaluate the expression into a _ValueExpression_ and store the listener
instance by calling _setValue()_ on the _ValueExpression_ . If there was
an exception thrown, rethrow the exception as a _JspException._

As an alternative to using the binding and/or
type attributes, you may also register a method in a backing bean class
to receive _ActionEvent_ notifications, by using the _actionListener_
attribute on the corresponding _UIComponent_ custom action.

=== Constraints

Must be nested inside a _UIComponent_ custom
action.

=== Description

Locate the closest parent _UIComponent_
custom action instance by calling
_UIComponentClassicTagBase.getParentUIComponentClassicTagBase()_ . Call
the _getValue()_ method on the argument _name_ to obtain the name of the
attribute. If the associated component already has a component attribute
with that name, take no action. Otherwise, call the _isLiteralText()_
method on the argument _value_ . If it returns _true_ , store the value
in the component’s attribute Map under the name derived above. If it
returns _false_ , store the _ValueExpression_ in the component’s
_ValueExpression_ Map under the name derived above.

There is no standard implementation class for
this action. It must be provided by the implementation.

|Predefined formatting style which determines
how the date component of a date string is to be formatted and parsed.
Applied only if type is "date", "both", "localDate", "localDateTime", or
"zonedDateTime". Valid values are "default", "short", "medium", "long",
and "full". Default value is "default". If a java.time formatter is
being used, yet the dateStyle is set to "default", the value "medium" is
assumed.

|locale |VE
|Locale or String
|Locale whose predefined styles for dates and
times are used during formatting or parsing. If not specified, the
Locale returned by FacesContext.getViewRoot().getLocale() will be used.
Value must be either a VE expression that evaluates to a
java.util.Locale instance, or a String that is valid to pass as the
first argument to the constructor java.util.Locale(String language,
String country). The empty string is passed as the second argument.

|pattern |VE
|String |Custom
formatting pattern which determines how the date/time string should be
formatted and parsed.

|time-Style |VE

|Time zone in which to interpret any time
information in the date string. Value must be either a VE expression
that evaluates to a java.util.TimeZone instance, or a String that is a
timezone ID as described in the javadocs for
java.util.TimeZone.getTimeZone().

|type |VE
|String |Specifies
what contents the string value will be formatted to include, or parsed
expecting. Valid values are "date", "time", "both", "localDate",
"localDateTime", "localTime", "offsetTime", "offsetDateTime", and
"zonedDateTime". The values starting with "local", "offset" and "zoned"
correspond to Java SE 8 Date Time API classes in package java.time with
the name derived by upper casing the first letter. For example,
java.time.LocalDate for the value "localDate". Default value is "date".

If _pattern_ is specified, the pattern syntax
must use the pattern syntax specified by _java.text.SimpleDateFormat_ or
_java.time.format.DateTimeFormatter_ depending on the value of type.

If _pattern_ is not specified, formatted
strings will contain a date value, a time value, or both depending on
the specified _type_ . When date or time values are included, they will
be formatted according to the specified _dateStyle_ and _timeStyle_ ,
respectively.

action that creates a _UISelectMany_ or _UISelectOne_ component
instance.

=== Description

Locate the closest parent _UIComponent_
custom action instance by calling
_UIComponentClassicTagBase.getParentUIComponentClassicTagBase()_ . If
the _getCreated()_ method of this instance returns _true_ , create a new
_UISelectItems_ component, and attach it as a child of the associated
_UIComponent_ .

=== <f:setPropertyActionListener>

Tag implementation that creates a special
_ActionListener_ instance and registers it on the _ActionSource_
associated with our most immediate surrounding instance of a tag whose
implementation class is a subclass of _UIComponentTag_ . This tag
creates no output to the page currently being created. This tag is
useful for pushing a specific value into a managed bean on page submit.

=== Syntax

<f:setPropertyActionListener target=”Value
Expression” value=”value Expression”/>

=== Body Content

empty.

is taken.

|target | _VE_
| _ValueExpression_
|The _ValueExpression_ into which the
evaluated value from the “ _value_ ” attribute is stored when the
listener executes.
|===

=== Constraints

Must be nested inside a _UIComponent_ custom
action.

The corresponding _UIComponent_
implementation class must implement _ActionSource_ , and therefore
define a public _addActionListener()_ method that accepts an
_ActionListener_ parameter.

The tag implementation must only create and
register the _ActionListener_ instance the first time the component for
this tag is created

When the listener executes:

Call _getValue()_ on the " _value_ "
_ValueExpression_ .

If value of the "value" expression is null,
call _setValue()_ on the "target" _ValueExpression_ with the null value.

If the value of the "value" expression is not
null, call _getType()_ on the "value" and "target" _ValueExpressions_ to
determine their property types.

Coerce the value of the "value" expression to
the "target" expression value type following the Expression Language
coercion rules. Call _setValue()_ on the "target" _ValueExpression_ with
the resulting value.

If either conversion or the execution of
setValue() fails throw an AbortProcessingException.

This tag creates no output to the page
currently being created. It is used solely for the side effect of
_ActionListener_ creation and addition.

[P1-end]

=== Description

Locate the closest parent _UIComponent_
custom action instance by calling
_UIComponentClassicTagBase.getParentUIComponentClassicTagBase()_ . If
the _getCreated()_ method of this instance returns _true_ return
_SKIP_BODY_ .

Create an instance of _ActionListener_ that
implements _StateHolder_ and stores the _target_ and _value_
_ValueExpression_ instances as instance variables included in the state
saving contract. The _processAction()_ method of the listener must call
_getValue()_ on the _value_ _ValueExpression_ and convert the value
before passing the result to a call to _setValue()_ on the _target_
_ValueExpression_ .

might be in a page that is including the page containing the
_<f:subview>_ custom action.

Must not contain an _<f:view>_ custom action.

Must have an _id_ attribute whose value is
unique within the scope of the parent naming container. If this
constraint is not met, the action taken regarding id uniqueness in

Implementation Requirements>> must be taken

{empty}May be placed in a parent page (with
_<jsp:include>_ or _<c:import>_ nested inside), or within the nested
page. [P1-end]

=== Description

Locate the closest parent _UIComponent_
custom action instance by calling
_UIComponentClassicTagBase.getParentUIComponentClassicTagBase()_ . If
the _getCreated()_ method of this instance returns _true_ , create a new
_UINamingContainer_ component, and attach it as a child of the
associated _UIComponent_ . Such a component provides a scope within
which child component identifiers must still be unique, but allows child
components to have the same simple identifier as child components nested
in some other naming container. This is useful in several scenarios:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
“main.jsp”

<f:view>

 <c:import url=”foo.jsp”/>

 <c:import url=”bar.jsp”/>

</f:view>



“foo.jsp”

<f:subview id=”aaa”>

 ... components and other content ...

</f:subview>



“bar.jsp”

<f:subview id=”bbb”>

 ... components and other content ...

</f:subview>

|===

In this scenario, _<f:subview>_ custom
actions in imported pages establish a naming scope for components within
those pages. Identifiers for _<f:subview>_ custom actions nested in a
single _<f:view>_ custom action must be unique, but it is difficult for
the page author (and impossible for the JSP page compiler) to enforce
this restriction.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
“main.jsp”

<f:view>

 <f:subview id=”aaa”>

 <c:import url=”foo.jsp”/>

 </f:subview>

 <f:subview id=”bbb”>

 <c:import url=”bar.jsp”/>

 </f:subview>

</f:view>



“foo.jsp”

... components and other content ...



“bar.jsp”

... components and other content ...

|===

In this scenario, the _<f:subview>_ custom
actions are in the including page, rather than the included page. As in
the previous scenario, the “id” values of the two subviews must be
unique; but it is much easier to verify using this style.

It is also possible to use this approach to
include the same page more than once, but maintain unique identifiers:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
“main.jsp”

<f:view>

 <f:subview id=”aaa”>

 <c:import url=”foo.jsp”/>

 </f:subview>

 <f:subview id=”bbb”>

 <c:import url=”foo.jsp”/>

 </f:subview>

</f:view>



“foo.jsp”

... components and other content ...





|===

In all of the above examples, note that
_foo.jsp_ and _bar.jsp_ may not contain _<f:view>_ .

The implementation class for this action must
meet the following requirements:

[P1-start f:subview implementation] Must
extend _jakarta.faces.UIComponentELTag_ .

The _getComponentType()_ method must return “

|===

=== Constraints

[P1-start f:view constraints] Any JSP-created
response using actions from the JSF Core Tag Library, as well as actions
extending _jakarta.faces.webapp.UIComponentELTag_ from other tag
libraries, must be nested inside an occurrence of the _<f:view>_ action.

JSP page fragments included via the standard
_<%@ include %>_ directive need not have their JSF actions embedded in a
_<f:view>_ action, because the included template text and custom actions
will be processed as part of the outer page as it is compiled, and the
_<f:view>_ action on the outer page will meet the nesting requirement.

If the _renderKitId_ attribute is present,
its value is stored in _UIViewRoot._ If the _renderKitId_ attribute is
not present, then the default render kit identifier as returned by
_Application.getDefaultRenderKitId()_ is stored in _UIViewRoot_ if it is
not _null._ Otherwise, the render kit identifier as specified by the
constant _RenderKitFactory.HTML_BASIC_RENDER_KIT_ is stored in
_UIViewRoot._ Specifying a _renderKitId_ for the current view also
affects all subsequent views, unless overridden by another use of the
_renderKitId_ attribute. Please refer to <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3871,See
ViewHandler>> for more information.

If the _locale_ attribute is present, its
value overrides the _Locale_ stored in _UIViewRoot_ , normally set by
the _ViewHandler, and the doStartTag() method must store it by calling
UIViewRoot.setLocale()_ .

{empty}The _doStartTag()_ method must call
_jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.set()_ , passing the
_ServletRequest_ instance for this request, the constant
_jakarta.servlet.jsp.jstl.core.Config.FMT_LOCALE_ , and the _Locale_
returned by calling _UIViewRoot.getLocale()_ . [P1-end]

=== Description

Provides the JSF implementation a convenient
place to perform state saving during the render response phase of the
request processing lifecycle, if the implementation elects to save state
as part of the response.

The implementation class for this action must
meet the following requirements:

Must extend _jakarta.faces.UIComponentELTag_ .

The _getComponentType()_ method must return
“ViewRoot”.

The _getRendererType()_ method must return
_null_ .

Please refer to the javadocs for
_jakarta.faces.application.StateManager_ for details on what the tag
handler for this tag must do to implement state saving.

=== Standard HTML RenderKit Tag Library

All JSF implementations must provide a tag
library containing actions that correspond to each valid combination of
a supported component class (see <<StandardUserInterfaceComponents.adoc#a1823,See
Standard User Interface Components>>”) and a _Renderer_ from the Standard
HTML RenderKit (see <<RenderingModel.adoc#a4314,See Standard HTML
RenderKit Implementation>>) that supports that component type. [P1-start
html_basic taglib requirements] The tag library descriptor for this tag
library must meet the following requirements:

Must declare a tag library version (
_<tlib-version>_ ) value of _1.2_ .

Must declare a URI ( _<uri>_ ) value of
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/html_ .

{empty}Must be included in the _META-INF_
directory of a JAR file containing the corresponding implementation
classes, suitable for inclusion with a web application, such that the
tag library descriptor will be located automatically by the algorithm
described in Section 7.3 of the _Jakarta Server Pages Specification_
(version 1.2).[P1-end]

[P1-start html_basic return values]The custom
actions defined in this tag library must specify the following return
values for the _getComponentType()_ and _getRendererType()_ methods,
respectively:.

Note, to avoid confusion between JSP and
Facelets, any Renderers that are only supported in Facelets are
specified in <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a6029,See Standard HTML RenderKit Tag
Library>>.

[P1-end] [P1-start html_basic taglibrary
requirements 2]The tag library descriptor for this tag library (and the
corresponding tag handler implementation classes) must meet the
following requirements:

The attributes for the tags, both in the TLD
and in the associated tag handlers, must conform exactly to the type,
name, and description given in the VDLDocs for the html_basic tag
library.

If the type of the attribute is
_jakarta.el.ValueExpression_ , the TLD for the attribute must contain a
_<deferred-value>_ with a nested _<type>_ element, inside of which is
nested the expected type, as given in the VDLDocs. The JavaBeans setter
method in the tag handler for the tag must be of type
_jakarta.el.ValueExpression_ .

If the type of the attribute is
_jakarta.el.MethodExpression_ , the TLD for the attribute must contain a
_<deferred-method>_ with a nested _<method-signature>_ , inside of which
is the method signature for that _MethodExpression_ , as given in the
VDLDocs. The actual name of the method in the signature declaration is
immaterial and unspecified. The JavaBeans setter method in the tag
handler for the tag must be of type _jakarta.el.MethodExpression_ .

Any attributes listed in the VDLDocs with a
_request-time_ value of _true_ must specify an _<rtexprvalue>_ of _true_
in the TLD.

The following action must be taken to handle
the value of the _converter_ property. If _isLiteralText()_ on the
_converter_ property returns _true_ , get the value of the property and
treat it as a _converterId_ by passing it as the argument to the
_createConverter()_ method of the _Application_ instance for this
webapp, then pass the created _Converter_ to the _setConverter()_ method
of the component for this tag. If _isLiteralText()_ on the _converter_
property returns _false_ , call _setValueExpression()_ on the component,
passing “converter” as the name of the _ValueExpression_ and the
_ValueExpression_ instance as the value.

For a non- _null_ _action_ attribute on
custom actions related to _ActionSource2_ components ( _commandButton_ ,
_commandLink_ ), the _setProperties()_ method of the tag handler
implementation class must pass the value of the action attribute, which
is a _MethodExpression_ , to the component’s _setActionExpression()_
method.

For other non- _null_ attributes that
correspond to _MethodExpression_ attributes on the underlying components
( _actionListener_ , _validator_ , _valueChangeListener_ ), the
_setProperties()_ method of the tag handler implementation class must
store that instance as the value of the corresponding component
property.

For any non- _null_ _id_ , _scope_ , or _var_
attribute, the _setProperties()_ method of the tag handler
implementation class must simply set the value of the corresponding
component attribute.

For all other non- _null_ attributes, the
_setProperties()_ of the tag handler implementation class method must:

If the _attribute.isLiteralText()_ returns
_true_ , set the corresponding attribute on the underlying component
(after performing any necessary type conversion).

{empty}Otherwise, call the
_setValueExpression()_ method on the underlying component, passing the
attribute name and the _ValueExpression‘_ instance as
parameters.[P1-end]

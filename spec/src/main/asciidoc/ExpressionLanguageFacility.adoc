== Expression Language Facility

In the descriptions of the standard user
interface component model, it was noted that all attributes, and nearly
all properties can have a _value expression_ associated with them (see
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a911,ValueExpression properties>>). In
addition, many properties, such as _action_, _actionListener_,
_validator_, and _valueChangeListener_ can be defined by a _method
expression_ pointing at a public method in some class to be executed.
This chapter describes the mechanisms and APIs that Jakarta Faces
utilizes in order to evaluate value expressions and method expressions.

Jakarta Faces relies on Jakarta Expression Language as described by version 4.0 of
the Jakarta Expression Language specification. 
Please consult that document for complete details about the Expression Language.

This chapter will focus exclusively on how Jakarta Faces leverages
and integrates with Jakarta Expression Language. It does not describe how Jakarta Expression Language operates.

[[a2349]]
=== Value Expressions

==== Overview

To support binding of attribute and property
of values to dynamically calculated results, the name of the attribute
or property can be associated with a value expression using the
_setValueExpression()_ method. Whenever the dynamically calculated
result of evaluating the expression is required, the _getValue()_ method
of the _ValueExpression_ is called, which returns the evaluated result.
Such expressions can be used, for example, to dynamically calculate a
component value to be displayed:

[source,xml]
----
<h:outputText value="#{customer.name}" />
----

which, when this page is rendered, will
retrieve the bean stored under the “customer” key, then acquire the name
property from that bean and render it.

Besides the component value itself, value
expressions can be used to dynamically compute attributes and
properties. The following example checks a _boolean_ property _manager_
on the current _user_ bean (presumably representing the logged-in user)
to determine whether the _salary_ property of an employee should be
displayed or not:

[source,xml]
----
<h:outputText rendered="#{user.manager}" value="#{employee.salary}" />
----

which sets the _rendered_ property of the
component to _false_ if the user is not a manager, and therefore causes
this component to render nothing.

The Jakarta Expression Language has a
powerful set of coercion rules that automatically convert the type of
the value to the appropriate type. These rules occasionally rely on the
JavaBeans _PropertyEditor_ facility to perform this conversion. Note
that this conversion is entirely separate from normal Jakarta Faces Conversion.

Value expressions can also be used to set a
value from the user into the item obtained by evaluating the expression.
For example:

[source,xml]
----
<h:inputText value="#{employee.number}" />
----

When the page is rendered, the expression is
evaluated as an r-value and the result is displayed as the default value
in the text field. When the page is submitted, the expression is
evaluated as an l-value, and the value entered by the user (subject to
conversion and validation as usual) is pushed into the expression.

==== Value Expression Syntax and Semantics

Please see Section 1.2 of the Jakarta Expression
Language Specification, Version 4.0 or higher for the complete specification of
ValueExpression syntax and semantics.


=== MethodExpressions

_Method expressions_ are a very similar to
value expressions, but rather than supporting the dynamic retrieval and
setting of properties, method expressions support the invocation (i.e.
execution) of an arbitrary public method of an arbitrary object, passing
a specified set of parameters, and returning the result from the called
method (if any). They may be used in any phase of the request processing
lifecycle; the standard Jakarta Faces components and framework employ them
(encapsulated in a _MethodExpression_ object) at the following times:

* During _Apply Request Values_ or _Invoke
Application_ phase (depending upon the state of the _immediate_
property), components that implement the _ActionSource_ behavioral
interface (see <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1090,ActionSource>>) utilize
_MethodExpressions_ as follows:

** If the _actionExpression_ property is
specified, it must be a _MethodExpression_ expression that identifies an
Application Action method (see <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3553,
Application Actions>>) that takes no parameters and returns a String.

** It’s possible to have a method expression act
as an _ActionListener_ by using the classs
_MethodExpressionActionListener_ to wrap a method expression and calling
the _addActionListener()_ method on the _ActionSource_. The method
expression wrapped inside the _MethodExpressionActionListener_ must
identify a public method that accepts an _ActionEvent_ (see
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1308,Event Classes>>) instance, and has a
return type of _void_. The called method has exactly the same
responsibilities as the _processAction()_ method of an _ActionListener_
instance (see <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1329,Listener Classes>>) that
was built in to a separate Java class.

* During the _Apply Request Values_ or _Process
Validations_ phase (depending upon the state of the _immediate_
property), components that implement _EditableValueHolder_ (such as
_UIInput_ and its subclasses) components (see
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1192,EditableValueHolder>>) utilize method
expressions as follows:

** The user can use the
_MethodExpressionValidator_ class to wrap a method expression that
identifies a public method that accepts a _FacesContext_ instance and a
_UIComponent_ instance, and an _Object_ containing the value to be
validated, and has a return type of _void_. This
_MethodExpressionValidator_ instance can then be added as a normal
_Validator_ using the _EditableValueHolder.addValidator()_ method. The
called method has exactly the same responsibilities as the _validate()_
method of a _Validator_ instance (see <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1414,
Validator Classes>>) that was built in to a separate Java class.

** The user can use the
_MethodExpressionValueChangeListener_ class to wrap a method expression
that identifies a public method that accepts a _ValueChangeEvent_ (see
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1308,Event Classes>>) instance, and has a
return type of _void_. This _MethodExpressionValueChangeListener_
instance can then be added as a normal _ValueChangeListener_ using
EditableValueHolder.addValueChangeListener(). The called method has
exactly the same responsibilities as the _processValueChange()_ method
of a _ValueChangeListener_ instance (see <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1329,
Listener Classes>>) that was built in to a separate Java class.

=== How Faces Leverages the Expression Language

This section is non-normative and covers the
major players in the Jakarta Expression Language and how they relate to Jakarta Faces.
The number one goal in this version of the Jakarta Faces
specification is to export the concepts behind the Jakarta Faces EL into the
Jakarta Expression Language, and then rely on those facilities to get the work done.
Readers interested in how to implement the Jakarta Expression Language itself must
consult the Jakarta Expression Language Spec document.

==== ELContext

The ELContext is a handy little “holder”
object that gets passed all around the Jakarta Expression Language API. It has two
purposes.

* To allow technologies that use the Jakarta Expression Language,
such as Jakarta Faces, Jakarta Server Pages and Jakarta Tags,
to store any context information specific to that
technology so it can be leveraged during expression evaluation. For
example the expression “_#{view.viewId}_” is specific to Jakarta Faces. It
means, “find the _UIViewRoot_ instance for the current view, and return
its _viewId_”. The Jakarta Expression Language doesn’t know about the “view” implicit
object or what a UIViewRoot is, but Jakarta Faces does. The Jakarta Expression Language
has plugin points that will get called to resolve “view”, but to do
so, Jakarta Faces needs access to the _FacesContext_ from within the
callstack of Expression Language evaluation. Therefore, the _ELContext_ comes to the
rescue, having been populated with the _FacesContext_ earlier in the
request processing lifecycle.

* To allow the pluggable resolver to tell the
Jakarta Expression Language that it did, in fact, resolve a property and that further
resolvers must not be consulted. This is done by setting the
“_propertyResolved_” property to _true_.

The complete specification for ELResolver may
be found in Chapter 2 of the Jakarta Expression Language Specification, Version
4.0.

===== Lifetime, Ownership and Cardinality

An ELContext instance is created the first
time _getELContext()_ is called on the _FacesContext_ for this request.
Please see _<<Per-RequestStateInformation.adoc#a3099,ELContext>>_ for details. Its
lifetime ends the same time the __FacesContext__’s lifetime ends. The
_FacesContext_ maintains the owning reference to the _ELContext_. There
is at most one _ELContext_ per _FacesContext_.

===== Properties

[width="100%",cols="20%,10%,20%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _ELResolver_ |RO
| _jakarta.el.ELResolver_

_<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2822,Faces ELResolver for Facelets and Programmatic Access>>_

| _propertyResolved_
|RW |boolean
|Set by an ELResolver implementation if it
successfully resolved a property. See _<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2634,
ELResolver>>_ for how this property is used.
|===

===== Methods

Here is a subset of the methods that are relevant to Jakarta Faces.

[source,java]
----
public Object getContext(Class key);
void putContext(Class key, Object contextInstance);
...
----

As mentioned in
_<<Per-RequestStateInformation.adoc#a3099,ELContext>>_, the _putContext()_ method
is called, passing the current _FacesContext_ instance the first time
the system asks the _FacesContext_ for its _ELContext_. The
_getContext()_ method will be called by any _ELResolver_ instances that
need to access the _FacesContext_ to perform their resolution.

===== Events

The creation of an ELContext instance
precipitates the emission of an _ELContextEvent_ from the _FacesContext_
that created it. Please see _<<Per-RequestStateInformation.adoc#a3099,ELContext>>_
for details.

[[a2634]]
==== ELResolver

Faces 1.1 used the _VariableResolver_ and
_PropertyResolver_ classes as the workhorses of expression evaluation.
The Unified API has the _ELResolver_ instead. The ELResolver concept is
the heart of the Jakarta Expression Language. When an expression is evaluated, the
ELResolver is responsible for resolving each segment in the expression.
For example, in rendering the component behind the tag “_<h:outputText
value="#{user.address.street}" />”_ the ELResolver is called three
times. Once to resolve “user”, again to resolve the “address” property
of user, and finally, to resolve the “street” property of “address”. The
complete specification for ELResolver may be found in Chapter 2 of the
Jakarta Expression Language Specification, Version 4.0 or higher.

As described
in more detail in _<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2664,
ELResolver Instance Provided by Faces>>_, Faces must provide an implementation of _ELResolver_.
During the course of evaluation of an
expression, a variety of sources must be considered to help resolve each
segment of the expression. These sources are linked in a chain-like
fashion. Each link in the chain has the opportunity to resolve the
current segment. If it does so, it must set the “_propertyResolved_”
property on the _ELContext_, to _true_. If not, it must not modify the
value of the “_propertyResolved_” property. If the
“_propertyResolved_” property is not set to _true_ the return value from
the _ELResolver_ method is ignored by the system.

===== Lifetime, Ownership, and Cardinality

ELResolver instances have application
lifetime and scope. The CDI container maintains one top level ELResolver
(into which a Faces specific ELResolver is added) accessible from
_BeanManager.getELResolver()_. This ELResolver instance is
also used from the Jakarta Faces VDL. Faces maintains one _ELResolver_ accessible from
_FacesContext.getELContext().getELResolver()_ and
_Application.getELResolver()_.

===== Properties

ELResolver has no proper JavaBeans properties

===== Methods

Here is a subset of the methods that are
relevant to Faces.

[source,java]
----
public Object getValue(ELContext context, Object base, Object property);
void setValue(ELContext context,
    Object base, Object property, Object value);
...
----

_getValue()_ looks at the argument _base_
and tries to return the value of the property named by the argument
_property_. For example, if base is a JavaBean, _property_ would be the
name of the JavaBeans property, and the resolver would end up calling
the _getter_ for that property.

_setValue()_ looks at the argument _base_
and tries to set the argument _value_ into the property named by the
argument _property_. For example, if base is a JavaBean, _property_
would be the name of the JavaBeans property, and the resolver would end
up calling the _setter_ for that property.

There are other methods, such as
_isReadOnly()_ that are beyond the scope of this document, but described
completely in the Jakarta Expression Language Specification.

===== Events

_ELResolver_ precipitates no events.

[[a2651]]
==== ExpressionFactory

The Jakarta Expression Language
owns the _ExpressionFactory_ class. It is a factory for
_ValueExpression_ and _MethodExpression_ instances.

===== Lifetime, Ownership, and Cardinality

_ExpressionFactory_ instances are
application scoped. The _Application_ object maintains the
_ExpressionFactory_ instance used by Faces (See
_<<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3459,Acquiring ExpressionFactory Instance>>)_.
The _ELManager_ object maintains the _ExpressionFactory_
used by the Jakarta Expression Language (and therefore by the Jakarta Faces VDL). It is
permissible for both of these access methods to yield the same java
object instance.

===== Properties

_ExpressionFactory_ has no properties.

===== Methods

[source,java]
----
public MethodExpression createMethodExpression(ELContext context,
    String expression, FunctionMapper fnMapper, Class[] paramTypes);
public ValueExpression createValueExpression(ELContext context,
    String expression, Class expectedType, FunctionMapper fnMapper);
----

These methods take the human readable
expression string, such as _"#{user.address.street}"_ and return an
object oriented representation of the expression. Which method one calls
depends on what kind of expression you need. The Faces _Application_
class has convenience methods specific to Faces needs for these
concepts, please see <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3463,Programmatically
Evaluating Expressions>> .

===== Events

_ExpressionFactory_ precipitates no events.


[[a2664]]
=== ELResolver Instance Provided by Faces

This section provides details on what an
implementation of the Jakarta Faces specification must do to support
the Jakarta Expression Language for usage in a Jakarta Faces application.

_<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2634,
ELResolver>>_ mentions that a Faces implementation must provide an
implementation of _ELResolver_. This _ELResolver_, let’s call it
the _Faces ELResolver for Facelets and Programmatic Access_, is used by
Facelets markup pages, and is returned from
_FacesContext.getELContext().getELResolver()_ and
_Application.getELResolver()_, and is used to resolve expressions that
appear programmatically. See the javadocs for _jakarta.el.ELResolver_ for
the specification and method semantics for each method in _ELResolver_.
The remainder of this section lists the implementation requirements for
this resolver.

[[a2771]]
==== ELResolvers from application configuration resources

The _<el-resolver>_ element in the
application configuration resources will contain the fully qualified
classname to a class with a public no-arg constructor that implements
_jakarta.el.ELResolver_. These are added to the _Faces ELResolver for
Facelets and Programmatic Access_ in
the order in which they occur in the application configuration
resources.

[[a2820]]
==== ELResolvers from Application.addELResolver()

Any such resolvers are considered at this
point in the _Faces ELResolver for Facelets and Programmatic Access_ in the order in which they
were added.

[[a2822]]
==== Faces ELResolver for Facelets and Programmatic Access

This section documents the requirements for
the second _ELResolver_ mentioned in _<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2664,
ELResolver Instances Provided by Faces>>_, the one that is used for
Facelets and for programmatic expression evaluation from Faces java
code.

The implementation for the _ELResolver for
Programmatic Access_ is described as a set of _ELResolvers_ inside of a
_CompositeELResolver_ instance, but any implementation strategy is
permissible as long as the semantics are preserved. .

This diagram shows the set of
_ELResolver_ instances that must be added to the _ELResolver for
Programmatic Access_. This instance must be returned from
_Application.getELResolver()_ and
_FacesContext.getELContext().getELResolver()_. It also shows the
order in which they must be added.

The semantics of each _ELResolver_ are given
below, either in tables that describe what must be done to implement
each particular method on _ELResolver_, in prose when such a table is
inappropriate, or as a reference to another section where the semantics
are exactly the same.

[[a2908]]
===== faces.CompositeComponentAttributesELResolver

This ELResolver makes it so expressions that
refer to the attributes of a composite component get correctly
evaluated. For example, the expression _#{cc.attrs.usernameLabel}_
says, “find the current composite component, call its _getAttributes()_
method, within the returned _Map_ look up the value under the key
“usernameLable”. If the value is a _ValueExpression_, call _getValue()_
on it and the result is returned as the evaluation of the expression.
Otherwise, if the value is _not_ a _ValueExpression_ the value itself is
returned as the evaluation of the expression.”

.Composite Component Attributes ELResolver

[width="100%",cols="25%,75%",options="header",]
|===
|ELResolver method
|implementation requirements
| _getValue_ a|
If base is non-null, is an instance of
UIComponent, is a composite component, and property is non-null and is
equal to the string “attrs”, return a Map implementation with the
following characteristics.

Wrap the attributes map of the composite
component and delegate all calls to the composite component attributes
map with the following exceptions:

get(), put(), and containsKey() are required
to be supported.

get(): if the result of calling get() on the
component attributes map is null, and a default value was declared in
the composite component metadata, the value will be a ValueExpression.
Evaluate it and return it. Otherwise, simply return the value from the
component attributes map.

put(): Call getValueExpression() on the
component. If this returns non-null, call setValue() on it, passing the
value argument as the last argument. Otherwise, simply call through to
put on the component attributes map.

containsKey(): If the attributes map contains
the key, return true. Otherwise, if a default value has been declared
for the attribute, return true. Otherwise, return false.

The Map implementation must also implement
the interface

jakarta.faces.el.CompositeComponentExpressionHolder.

Otherwise, take no action.

| _getType_ |If
the base argument to getType() is not an instance of the composite
component attributes map or the property argument to getType() is not an
instance of java.lang.String, return null. Otherwise, check the top
level component's ValueExpression collection for an expression under the
name given by the property argument to getType(). If the expression
exists, call getType() on the expression. If the property argument to
getType() is not empty, search the composite component's metadata for a
declared type on a <cc:attribute> whose name matches the property
argument to getType(). If the expression and the metadata both yield
results, the metadata takes precedence ONLY if it provides a narrower
result than does the expression, i.e. expression type is assignable from
metadata type. If the metadata result does take precedence, call
ELContext.setPropertyResolved(true). Otherwise, return whichever result
was available, or null.

If base and property are not null, and base
is an instance of ResourceHandler (as will be the case with an
expression such as __#{resource['jakarta.faces:faces.js']}__, perform the following.
(Note: This is possible due to the ImplicitObjectELResolver returning
the ResourceHandler, see <<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2830,
Implicit Objects for Facelets and Programmatic Access>>)

* If _property_ does not contain a colon
character ‘:’, treat _property_ as the _resourceName_ and pass
_property_ to _ResourceHandler.createResource(resourceName)_.

* If _property_ contains a single colon
character ‘:’, treat the content before the ‘:’ as the _libraryName_ and
the content after the ‘:’ as the _resourceName_ and pass both to
_ResourceHandler.createResource(resourceName, libraryName)_. If the
value of _libraryName_ is the literal string “this” (without the
quotes), discover the library name of the current resource (or the
contract name of the current resource, the two are mutually exclusive)
and replace “this” with that library name (or contract name) before
calling _ResourceHandler.createResource()_. In the case of resource
library contracts, _libraryName_ will actually be the contract name.

* If _property_ contains more than one colon
character ‘:’, throw a localized _ELException_, including _property_.

If one of the above steps results in the
creation of a non-null Resource instance, call
ELContext.setPropertyResolved(true). Call the getRequestPath() method on
the Resource instance, pass the result through
ExternalContext.encodeResourceUrl() and return the result.

If found, replace that entry with argument value. If not found, call
externalContext.getRequestMap().put(property, value).

Call setPropertyResolved(true) and return;

| _isReadOnly_ a|
If base is false, setPropertyResolved(true)
return false;

Otherwise, return false;

| _getFeatureDescriptors_ a|
If base is non-null, return null.

If base is null, return an Iterator of
java.beans.FeatureDescriptor instances for all attributes in all scopes.
The FeatureDescriptor name and shortName is the name of the scoped
attribute. The actual runtime type of the attribute must be stored as
the value of the ELResolver.TYPE attribute. Boolean.TRUE must be set as
the value of the ELResolver.RESOLVABLE_AT_DESIGN_TIME attribute. The
shortDescription must be a suitable description depending on the
implementation. The expert and hidden properties must be false. The
preferred property must be true.

| _getCommonPropertyType_ a|
If base is non-null, return null.

If base is null return String.class.

=== Current Expression Evaluation APIs

==== ELResolver

Please see
_<<ExpressionLanguageFacility.adoc#a2634,ELResolver>>_ for more details.

[[a3029]]
==== ValueExpression

It is the main object oriented abstraction for
an Expression Language expression that results in a value either being retrieved or set.
Please see Chapter 2 of the Jakarta Expression Language Specification, Version
4.0 or higher.

[[a3039]]
==== MethodExpression

It is the main object oriented abstraction for
an Expression Language expression that results in a method being invoked. Please see
Chapter 2 of the Jakarta Expression Language Specification, Version 4.0 or higher.

==== Expression Evaluation Exceptions

Four exception classes are defined to report
errors related to the evaluation of value exceptions:

- _jakarta.el.ELException_ (which extends
_java.lang.Exception_)—used to report a problem evaluating a value
exception dynamically.

- _MethodNotFoundException_ (which extends
_jakarta.el.ELException_)—used to report that a requested public method
does not exist in the context of evaluation of a method expression.

- _jakarta.el.PropertyNotFoundException_ (which
extends _jakarta.el.ELException_)—used to report that a requested
property does not exist in the context of evaluation of a value
expression.

- _jakarta.el.PropertyNotWriteableException_
(which extends _jakarta.el.ELException_)—used to indicate that the
requested property could not be written to when evaluating the
expression.

=== CDI Integration

Jakarta Faces must run in a container that supports CDI version 3.0 or higher. This requirement
allows CDI to provide all the functionality of the managed bean facility in a
better integrated way with the rest of the Jakarta EE platform. Delegating
these features to CDI allows them to evolve independently of Jakarta Faces. The
remainder of this section specifies some details of CDI integration
pertinent to Jakarta Faces.

[[a3054]]
==== Jakarta Faces Objects Valid for @Inject Injection

It must be possible to inject the following
Jakarta Faces objects into other objects using _@Inject_.

.Maps Returned by Various Jakarta Faces Accessors

The annotations in package
_jakarta.faces.annotation_ are used to cause _@Inject_ injection of the
corresponding _Map_ into a field. Generics may be used.

.Jakarta Faces Objects

It must be possible to _@Inject_ the following Jakarta Faces and Jakarta EE objects into CDI beans.

- _jakarta.faces.application.ResourceHandler_

- _jakarta.faces.context.ExternalContext_

- _jakarta.faces.context.FacesContext_

- _jakarta.faces.context.Flash_

- _jakarta.servlet.http.HttpSession_

.Support for Injection into Jakarta Faces Managed Objects

It must be possible to use _@Inject_ when
specifying the following kinds of Jakarta Faces managed objects.

- Validators declared with
_@jakarta.faces.validator.FacesValidator(managed=true)_

- Converters declared with
_@jakarta.faces.convert.FacesConverter(managed=true)_

- FacesBehaviors declared with
_@jakarta.faces.component.behavior.FacesBehavior(managed=true)_

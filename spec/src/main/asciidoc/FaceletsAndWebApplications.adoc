== Facelets and its use in Web Applications

As of version 2 of the Jakarta Server Faces specification,
 implementations must support (although JSF-based
applications need not utilize) using Facelets as the view declaration
language for JSF pages. Facelets technology was created by JSR-252 EG
Member Jacob Hookom.

=== Non-normative Background

To aid implementors in providing a spec
compliant runtime for Facelets, this section provides a non-normative
background to motivate the discussion of the Facelets feature. Facelets
is a replacement for JSP that was designed from the outset with JSF in
mind. New features introduced in version 2 and later are only exposed to
page authors using Facelets. JSP is retained for backwards
compatibility.

=== Differences between JSP and Facelets

Facelets was the first non-JSP view
declaration language designed for Jakarta Server Faces. As such, Facelets
was able to provide a simpler and more powerful programming model to JSF
developers than that provided by JSP, largely by leveraging JSF as much
as possible without carrying backwards compatibility with JSP. The
following table lists some of the differences between Facelets and JSP



=== Comparison of Facelets and JSP

Feature Name

JSP

Facelets

Pages are compiled to...

A Servlet that gets executed each time the
page renders. The UIComponent hierarchy is built by the presence of
custom tags in the page.

An abstract syntax tree that, when executed,
builds a UIComponent hierarchy.

Handling of tag attributes

All tag attributes must be declared in a TLD
file. Conformance instances of components in a page with the expected
attributes can be enforced with a taglibrary validator.

Tag attributes are completely dynamic and
automatically map to properties, attributes and ValueExpressions on
UIComponent instances

Page templating

Not supported, must go outside of core JSP

Page templating is a core feature of Facelets

Performance

Due to the common implementation technique of
compiling a JSP page to a Servlet, performance can be slow

Facelets is simpler and faster than JSP

EL Expressions

Expressions in template text cause unexpected
behavior when used in JSP

Expressions in template text operate as
expected.

JCP Standard

Yes, the specification is separate from the
implementation for JSP

No, the specification is defined by and is
one with the implementation.

=== Differences between Pre JSF 2.0 Facelets and Facelets in JSF 2.0

The work of taking a snapshot of a version of
Facelets and producing the specification for Facelets in JSF 2.0
consists of extracting the parts of Facelets that are intended to be
“public” and leaving the rest as implementation details. A decision was
made early in this process to strive for backwards compatibility between
the latest popular version of Facelets and Facelets in JSF 2.0. The sole
determinant to backwards compatibility lies in the answer to the
question, “is there any Java code in the application, or in libraries
used by the application, that extends from or depends on any class in
package _com.sun.facelets_ and/or its sub-packages?”

If the answer to this question is “yes”,
Facelets in JSF 2.0 is _not_ backwards compatibile with Facelets and
such an application _must_ continue to bundle the Facelets jar file
along with the application, continue to set the Facelets configuration
parameters, and also set the
_jakarta.faces.DISABLE_FACELET_JSF_VIEWHANDLER_ _<context-param>_ to
_true_ . Please see <<UsingJSFInWebApplications.adoc#a6088,See Application
Configuration Parameters>> for details on this option. Any code that
extends or depends on any class in package _com.sun.facelets_ and/or its
sub-packages must be modified to depend on the appropriate classes in
package _jakarta.faces.webapp.vdl_ and/or its sub-packages.

If the answer to this question is “no”,
Facelets in JSF 2.0 _is_ backwards compatible with pre-JSF 2.0 Facelets
and such an application _must not_ continue to bundle the Facelets jar
file along with the application, and _must not_ continue to set the
Facelets configuration parameters.

Thankfully, most applications that use
Facelets fall into the latter category, or, if they fall in the former,
their dependence will easily be migrated to the new public classes.

Facelets in JSF 2.0 provides tag libraries
that are compatible with the following libraries already found in pre
JSF 2.0 Facelets.

=== Taglibs in pre JSF 2.0 Facelets that are available in Facelets in JSF 2.0

Common prefix

c

http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core

fn

Naturally, new features built on Facelets in
JSF 2.0 are not available in pre JSF 2.0 Facelets and will only work in
JSF 2.0 or later.

[[a5526]]
=== Resource Library Contracts Background

JSF defines a system called “resource library
contracts” for applying facelet templates to an entire application in a
re-usable and interchangeable manner. The feature is built on top of the
resource library facility described in <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a836,See
Libraries of Localized and Versioned Resources>>. A configurable set of
Facelet VDL views in the application will be able to declare themselves
to be template-clients of any template in a resource library contract.
Facelet VDL views in the application can also make use of resources
contained in a resource library contract, but the feature has ample
value when only used with templates.

=== Non-normative Example

Consider this resource library contract,
called _siteLayout_ .

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|siteLayout/ +
topNav_template.xhtml +
leftNav_foo.xhtml +
styles.css +
script.js +
background.png
|===

This simple example takes advantage of
several conventions built into the feature, most notably the default
application of all available contracts in the application to all views
in the application. It is possible to customize how resource library
contracts are applied to the application, including using several
different contracts in the same or different parts of the application.
Such customizing is accomplished by including a
_<resource-library-contracts>_ element within the _<application>_
element of the _faces-config.xml_ (or similar) file. Because this
example is designed with the convention in mind, it does not need a
_faces-config.xml_ file.

The _siteLayout_ contract offers two
templates: _topNav_template.xhtml_ and _leftNav_foo.xhtml_ . For
discussion, these are known as “declared templates”. When used by a
template client, they will lay out the template client’s contents with a
navigation menu on the top or the left side of the page, respectively.
In _siteLayout_ , each of the templates has _<ui:insert>_ tags named
“title”, “content”, and “nav”. For discussion, these are knows as
“declared insertion points”. Furthermore, each of the templates uses the
CSS styles declared in _styles.css_ , some scripts defined in
_script.js_ , and the background image _background.png_ . For
discussion, these are known as “declared resources”. In order to use a
resource library contract, one must know its declared templates, their
declared insertion points, and, optionally, their declared resources. No
constraint is placed on the naming and arrangement of declared
templates, insertion points, or resources, but all three concepts
together can informally be thought of as the declaration of the resource
library contract. The contract declaration of _siteLayout_ can be stated
as follows.

_siteLayout_ provides two declared
templates, _topNav_template.xhtml_ and _leftNav_foo.xhtml_ . Each
templates offers declared insertion points “title”, “content”, and
“nav”.

In this case, the css, script, and image are
left out of the contract declaration but this distinction is completely
arbitrary. The important content of _topNav_template.xhtml_ is shown
next.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===

</h:body>

</html>

|===



This example packages the entire _siteLayout_
directory and its contents into the _META-INF/contracts_ entry of a JAR
file named _siteLayout.jar_ . The simplest possible way to use
_siteLayout_ is to drop _siteLayout.jar_ into _WEB-INF/lib_ and apply
the knowledge of the resource library contract declaration to the
facelet views in the app.

Consider this simple web app, called
_useContract_ , the file layout for which is shown next. The example is
shown using a simplified maven war packaging.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|useContract/ +

/WEB-INF/lib/siteLayout.jar +
index.xhtml +

|===

Notice the absence of a _faces-config.xml_
file. Because this example is content to let all the contracts in
_siteLayout.jar_ be applied to all views in the app, this file is not
necessary. The two pages are shown next.

</ui:define> +
<ui:define name=”nav”>Hard coded nav</ui:define> +
</ui:composition> +
</body> +
</html>
|===

To complete the example, the execution of the
_useContract_ app is illustrated.

When _useContract.war_ is deployed, the
runtime will discover that _siteLayout.jar_ is a resource library
contract and make its contents available for template clients.

When the user agent visits
_http://localhost:8080/useContract/faces/index.xhtml_ , because the
_siteLayout_ resource library contract provides _/topNav_template.xhtml_
, that file will be loaded as the template. Likewise, when the _next_
button is pressed, _/leftNav_foo.xhtml_ , also from _siteLayout_ ,will
be loaded as the template.

Now, consider there is an alternate
implementation of the _siteLayout_ contract, packaged as
_newSiteLayout.jar_ . This implementation doesn’t change the contract
declaration, but completely changes the arrangement and style of the
views. As long as the contract declaration does not change,
_useContract_ can take advantage of _newSiteLayout_ simply by replacing
one JAR in _WEB-INF/lib_ .

=== Non-normative Feature Overview

The normative requirements of the feature are
stated in the context of the part of the specification impacted. This
section gives the reader a non-normative overview of the feature that
touches on all the parts of the specification that intersect with this
feature.

_Design Time_

At design time, the developer has packaged
any resource library contracts to be used in the application in the
right place in the web application, or JAR file classpath. _This
behavior is normatively specified in <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a872,See
Resource Library Contracts>>._

 _Startup Time_

At startup time, the runtime will discover
the set of resource library contracts available for this application. If
there is one or more _<resource-library-contracts>_ element, only those
contracts explicitly named will be made available for use in the
application. If there is no such element, all of the discovered
contracts are made available for use in the application. _This behavior
is normatively specified in <<UsingJSFInWebApplications.adoc#a6215,See Resource
Library Contracts>> and in the XML schema for the application
configuration resources._

_Facelet Processing Time_

The specification for
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.createView()_ requires a call to
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.calculateResourceLibraryContracts()_ , passing
the current _viewId_ . This method will examine the data structure
assembled at startup and return a _List<String>_ representing the
resource library contracts eligible for use in this view. This value is
set as the value of the _resourceLibraryContracts_ property on the
_FacesContext_ . _This behavior is normatively specified in
<<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a4016,See ViewDeclarationLanguage.createView()>>._

The specification of the tag handler for
_<f:view>_ is the one other place where the _resourceLibraryContracts_
property may be set. _This behavior is normatively specified in the tag
handler for <f:view>._

In any _<ui:composition>_ or _<ui:decorate>_
tag reached from that view, it is valid to use any of the templates in
any of the listed contracts as the value of the _template_ attribute.
This behavior happens naturally as a side effect of the requirements of
_ResourceHandler.createViewResource()_ , where the implementation of
that method is required to first consult the _resourceLibraryContracts_
property of the current _FacesContext_ . If the value of the property is
non- _null_ and non empty, the implementation must first look for the
named view resource within each of the contracts in the list, and return
the first matching one found. Otherwise, the implementation just returns
the matching resource, if found. _This behavior is normatively specified
in the javadoc for ResourceHandler.createViewResource()._

_View Rendering Time_

When the view is being rendered, any
resources that reside in a resource library contract will have
additional metadata so that a subsequent request from the user agent is
able to quickly find the resource inside the named contract. _This
behavior is normatively specified in the javadoc for
Resource.getRequestPath()._

_User-Agent Rendering Time_

By the point in time that the User-Agent is
rendering the view, all of the work related to resource library
contracts will have been completed, but it is worth mentioning that any
resources in the page that originate from within resource library
contracts will be correctly fetched.

[[a5581]]
=== HTML5 Friendly Markup

Prior to version 2.2 of this specification,
the view authoring model relied entirely on the concept of a JSF UI
component in a view as a means to encapsulate arbitrarily complex web
user interface code behind a simple UI component tag in a page. For
example, the act of including _<my:datePicker value=”#\{user.dob}” />_
in a view could cause a large amount of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
images to be delivered to the user agent. This abstraction is very
appropriate when the view author is content to delegate the work of
designing the user experience for such components to a component author.
As web designer skills have become more widespread, the need has arisen
to expose the hitherto hidden complexity so the view author has near
total control on the user experience of each individual element in the
view. The HTML5 Friendly Markup feature addresses this requirement, as
well as providing access to the loosened attribute syntax also present
in HTML5.

This feature is only available to views
written in Facelets. It is not available to views written in JSP.

=== Non-normative Feature Overview

The normative requirements of the feature are
stated in the context of the part of the specification impacted. This
section gives the reader a non-normative overview of the feature that
touches on all the parts of the specification that intersect with this
feature. There are two main aspects to the feature, pass through
attributes and pass through elements.

_Pass Through Attributes_

For any given JSF component tag in a view,
the set of available attributes that component supports is determined by
a combination of the _UIComponent_ and _Renderer_ for that tag. In some
cases the value of the attribute is interpreted by the _UIComponent_ or
_Renderer_ (for example, the _columns_ attribute of _h:panelGrid_ ) and
in others the value is passed straight through to the user agent (for
example, the _lang_ attribute of _h:inputText_ ). In both cases, the
_UIComponent/Renderer_ has a priori knowledge of the set of allowable
attributes. _Pass Through Attributes_ allows the view author to list
arbitrary name value pairs that are passed straight through to the user
agent without interpretation by the _UIComponent/Renderer_ . _This
behavior is normatively specified in the “Rendering Pass Through
Attributes” section of the overview of the standard HTML_BASIC render
kit._

The view author may specify pass through
attributes in three ways.

Nesting the _<f:passThroughAttribute>_ tag
within a _UIComponent_ tag. For example, +
_<h:inputText value=”#\{user.name}”> +
<f:passThroughAttribute name=”data-sermon” value=”#\{pastor.message}”
/> +
</h:inputText>_

Nesting the _<f:passThroughAttributes>_ tag
within a _UIComponent_ tag, For example, +
_<h:inputText value=”#\{user.name”> +
<f:passThroughAttributes value=”#\{service.nameValuePairs}” /> +
</h:inputText> +
_ The EL expression must point to a _Map<String, Object>_ . If the value
is a _ValueExpresison_ call _getValue()_ the value first. Whether the
value is a _ValueExpression_ or not, the value must have its
_toString()_ called on it.

Prefixing the attribute with the shortname
assigned to the _http://java.sun.com/jsf/passthrough_ XML namespace. For
example +
_<html xmlns:p=”http://java.sun.com/jsf/passthrough” +
xmlns:h=”http://java.sun.com/jsf/html”> +
<h:inputText p:foo=”\{bar.baz}” value=”#\{user.name}” /> +
</html>_

_This behavior is normatively specified in
the VDLdoc for <f:passthroughAttribute>, <f:passThroughAttributes> tags
in the “Faces Core” tag library, and the “Pass Through Attributes” tag
library._

_Pass Through Elements_

This feature circumvents the traditional
component abstraction model of JSF, allowing the page author nearly
complete control of the rendered markup, without sacrificing any of the
server side lifecycle offered by JSF. This is accomplished by means of
enhancements to the Facelet _TagDecorator_ API. This API describes a
mapping from the common markup elements to target tags in the HTML_BASIC
RenderKit such that the actual markup specified by the view author is
what gets rendered, but the server side component is an actual component
from the HTML_BASIC RenderKit. A special _Renderer_ is provided to cover
cases when none of the mappings specified in _TagDecorator_ fit the
incoming markup. To allow further flexibility, the existing Facelets
TagDecorator mechanism allows complete control of the mapping process.
_This behavior is normatively specified in the javadocs for class
jakarta.faces.view.facelets.TagDecorator and in the section “Rendering
Pass Through Attributes” in the “General Notes On Encoding” in the
Standard HTML_BASIC RenderKit._

An example will illustrate the mapping
process.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<!DOCTYPE HTML> +
<html xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” +
xmlns:jsf=”http://java.sun.com/jsf”> +
<body> +
<input type=”number” pattern=”[0-9]*” jsf:value=”#\{my.age}” /> +
</body> +
</html>
|===

As required in
<<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5608,See Specification of the
ViewDeclarationLanguage Implementation for Facelets for JSF 2.0>>
_TagDecorator_ is called during the facelet processing. Because the
_<input>_ element has an attribute from the _http://java.sun.com/jsf_
namespace, the system treats the element as a pass through element. The
table listed in the javadocs for _TagDecorator_ is consulted and it is
determined that this component should act as an _<h:inputText>_
component for the purposes of postback processing. However, the
rendering is entirely taken from the markup in the facelet view. Another
example illustrates the special _Renderer_ that is used when no mapping
can be found in the table in the javadocs for _TagDecorator_ .

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<!DOCTYPE HTML> +
<html xmlns=”http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml” +
xmlns:jsf=”http://java.sun.com/jsf”> +
<body> +
<meter jsf:id="meter2" min="#\{bean.min}" max="#\{bean.max}" +
value="350">350 degrees</meter> +
</body> +
</html>
|===

As in the preceding example, the
_TagDecorator_ mechanism is activated but it is determined that this
component should act as a _<jsf:element>_ component for the purposes of
postback processing. _The behavior of the <jsf:element> is normatively
specified in the VDLdoc for that tag. The behavior of the
jakarta.faces.passthrough.Element renderer is normatively specified in the
RenderKitDoc for that renderer._


=== Java Programming Language Specification for Facelets in JSF 2.0

The subsections within this section specify
the Java API requirements of a Facelets implementation. Adherence to
this section and the next section, which specifies the XHTML
specification for Facelets in JSF 2.0, will ensure applications and JSF
component libraries that make use of Facelets are portable across
different implementations of Jakarta Server Faces.

The original Facelet project did not separate
the API and the implementation into separate jars, as is common practice
with JCP specifications. Thus, a significant task for integrating
Facelets into JSF 2 was deciding which classes to include in the public
Java API, and which to keep as an implementation detail.

There were two guiding principles that
influenced the task of integrating Facelets into JSF 2.

The original decision in JSF 1.0 to allow the
ViewHandler to be pluggable enabled the concept of a View Declaration
Language for JSF. The two most popular ones were Facelets and
JSFTemplating. The new integration should preserve this pluggability,
since it is still valuable to be able to replace the View Declaration
Language.

After polling users of Facelets, the expert
group decided that most of them were only using the markup based API and
were not extending from the Java classes provided by the Facelet
project. Therefore, we decided to keep the Java API for Facelets in JSF
2 as small as possible, only exposing classes where absolutely
necessary.

The application of these principles produced
the classes in the package _jakarta.faces.view.facelets_ . Please consult
the Javadocs for that package, and the classes within it, for additional
normative specification _._

[[a5608]]
=== Specification of the ViewDeclarationLanguage Implementation for Facelets for JSF 2.0

As normatively specified in the javadocs for
_ViewDeclarationLanguageFactory.getViewDeclarationLanguage()_ , a JSF
implementation must guarantee that a valid and functional
_ViewDeclarationLanguage_ instance is returned from this method when the
argument is a reference to either a JSP view, a Faces XML View or a
Facelets View. This section describes the specification for the Facelets
implementation.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void buildView(FacesContext context,

 UIViewRoot root)

 throws IOException



|===

The argument _root_ will have been created
with a call to either _createView()_ or
_ViewMetadata.createMetadataView()_ . If the root already has
non-metadata children, the view must still be re-built, but care must be
taken to ensure that the existing components are correctly paired up
with their VDL counterparts in the VDL page. The implementation must
examine the _viewId_ of the argument root, which must resolve to an
entity written in Facelets for JSF 2 markup language. Because Facelets
for JSF 2.0 views are written in XHTML, an XML parser is well suited to
the task of processing such an entity. Each element in the XHTML view
falls into one of the following categories, each of which corresponds to
an instance of a Java object that implements
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.FaceletHandler_ , or a subinterface or
subclass thereof, and an instance of
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.TagConfig_ , or a subinterface or subclass
thereof, which is passed to the constructor of the object implementing
_FaceletHandler_ .

When constructing the _TagConfig_
implementation to be passed to the _FaceletHandler_ implementation, the
runtime must ensure that the instance returned from _TagConfig.getTag()_
has been passed through the tag decoration process as described in the
javadocs for _jakarta.faces.view.facelets.TagDecorator_ prior to the
_TagConfig_ being passed to the _FaceletHandler_ implementation.

The mapping between the categories of
elements in the XHTML view and the appropriate sub-interface or subclass
of _FaceletHandler_ is specified below. Each _FaceletHandler_ instance
must be traversed and its _apply()_ method called in the same
depth-first order as in the other lifecycle phase methods in jsf. Each
_FaceletHandler_ instance must use the _getNextHandler()_ method of the
_TagConfig_ instance passed to its constructor to perform the traversal
starting from the root _FaceletHandler_ .

Standard XHTML markup elements

These are declared in the XHTML namespace
_http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml_ . Such elements should be passed through
as is to the rendered output.

These elements correspond to instances of
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.TextHandler_ . See the javadocs for that
class for the normative specification.

Markup elements that represent _UIComponent_
instance in the view.

These elements can come from the Standard
HTML Renderkit namespace _http://java.sun.com/jsf/html_ , or from the
namespace of a custom tag library (including composite components) as
described in <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5638,See Facelet Tag Library
mechanism>>.

These elements correspond to instances of
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.ComponentHandler_ . See the javadocs for that
class for the normative specification.

Markup elements that take action on their
parent or children markup element(s). Usually these come from the JSF
Core namespace _http://java.sun.com/jsf/core_ , but they can also be
provided by a custom tag library.

Such elements that represent an attached
object must correspond to an appropriate subclass of
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.FaceletsAttachedObjectHandler_ . The
supported subclasses are specified in the javadocs.

Such elements that represent a facet
component must correspond to an instance of
_jakarta.faces.component.FacetHandler_ .

Such elements that represent an attribute
that must be pushed into the parent _UIComponent_ element must
correspond to an instance of
_jakarta.facelets.view.facelets.AttributeHandler_ .

Markup Elements that indicate facelet
templating, as specified in the VDL Docs for the namespace
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/facelets_ .

Such elements correspond to an instance of
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.TagHandler_ .

Markup elements from the Facelet version of
the JSTL namespaces _http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/core_ or
_http://java.sun.com/jsp/jstl/functions_ , as specified in the VDL Docs
for those namespaces.

Such elements correspond to an instance of
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.TagHandler_ .


=== XHTML Specification for Facelets for JSF 2.0

[[a5632]]
=== General Requirements

[P1-start_facelet_xhtml]Facelet pages are
authored in XHTML. The runtime must support all XHTML pages that conform
to the XHTML-1.0-Transitional DTD, as described at
_http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#a_dtd_XHTML-1.0-Transitional_ .

The runtime must ensure that EL expressions
that appear in the page without being the right-hand-side of a tag
attribute are treated as if they appeared on the right-hand-side of the
_value_ attribute of an _<h:outputText />_ element in the
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/html_ namespace. This behavior must happen
regardless of whether or not the _http://java.sun.com/jsf/html_
namespace has been declared in the page.

[[a5635]]
=== DOCTYPE and XML Declaration

When processing Facelet VDL files, the system
must ensure that at most one XML declaration and at most one DOCTYPE
declaration appear in the rendered markup, if and only if there is
corresponding markup in the Facelet VDL files for those elements. If
multiple occurrences of XML declaration and DOCTYPE declaration are
encountered when processing Facelet VDL files, the “outer-most”
occurrence is the one that must be rendered. If an XML declaration is
present, it must be the very first markup rendered, and it must precede
any DOCTYPE declaration (if present). The output of the XML and DOCTYPE
declarations are subject to the configuration options listed in the
table titled “Valid <process-as> values and their implications on the
processing of Facelet VDL files” in <<JSFMetadata.adoc#a7061,See The
facelets-processing element>>.

{empty}[P1-end_facelet_xhtml]

[[a5638]]
=== Facelet Tag Library mechanism

Facelets leverages the XML namespace
mechanism to support the concept of a “tag library” analogous to the
same concept in JSP. However, in Facelets, the role of the tag handler
java class is greatly reduced and in most cases is unnecessary. The tag
library mechanism has two purposes.

Allow page authors to access tags declared in
the supplied tag libraries declared in <<JSFMetadata.adoc#a5691,See
Standard Facelet Tag Libraries>>, as well as accessing third-party tag
libraries developed by the application author, or any other third party

Define a framework for component authors to
group a collection of custom _UIComponent_ s into a tag library and
expose them to page authors for use in their pages.

[P1_start_facelet_taglib_decl]The runtime
must support the following syntax for making the tags in a tag library
available for use in a Facelet page.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

 xmlns: _prefix_ =" _namespace_uri_ ">

|===

Where _prefix_ is a page author chosen
arbitrary string used in the markup inside the _<html>_ tag to refer to
the tags declared within the tag library and _namespace_uri_ is the
string declared in the _<namespace>_ element of the facelet tag library
descriptor. For example, declaring
_xmlns:h="http://java.sun.com/jsf/html"_ within the _<html>_ element in
a Facelet XHTML page would cause the runtime to make all tags declared
in <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a6029,See Standard HTML RenderKit Tag Library>>
to be available for use in the page using syntax like: _<h:inputText />_
.

The unprefixed namespace, also known as the
root namespace, must be passed through without modification or check for
validity. The passing through of the root namespace must occur on any
non-prefixed element in a facelet page. For example, the following
markup declaration:.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" +
xmlns: _h_ =" _http://java.sun.com/jsf/html_ "> +

would be rendered as

{empty}[P1_end_facelet_taglib_decl]

[P1_start_facelet_taglib_discovery]The run
time must support two modes of discovery for Facelet tag library
descriptors

{empty}Via declaration in the web.xml, as
specified in <<UsingJSFInWebApplications.adoc#a6088,See Application Configuration
Parameters>>

Via auto discovery by placing the tag library
discriptor file within a jar on the web application classpath, naming
the file so that it ends with “ _.taglib.xml_ ”, without the quotes, and
placing the file in the _META-INF_ directory in the jar file.

{empty}The discovery of tag library files
must happen at application startup time and complete before the
application is placed in service. Failure to parse, process and
otherwise interpret any of the tag library files discovered must cause
the application to fail to deploy and must cause an informative error
message to be logged.[P1_end_facelet_taglib_discovery]

The specification for how to interpret a
facelet tag library descriptor is included in the documentation elements
of the schema for such files, see <<JSFMetadata.adoc#a7134,See XML
Schema Definition For Facelet Taglib>>.


[[a5661]]
=== Requirements specific to composite components

The text in this section makes use of the
terms defined in <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1619,See Composite Component
Terms>>. When such a term appears in this section, it will be in
_emphasis font face_ .

[[a5663]]
=== Declaring a composite component library for use in a Facelet page

[P1_start_composite_library_decl]The runtime
must support the following two ways of declaring a _composite component
library_ .

If a facelet taglibrary is declared in an
XHTML page with a namespace starting with the string “
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/_ ” (without the quotes), the
remainder of the namespace declaration is taken as the name of a
resource library as described in <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a836,See
Libraries of Localized and Versioned Resources>>, as shown in the
following example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<html xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"

 xmlns: _ez_ ="
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/_ ezcomp">

|===

The runtime must look for a resource library
named _ezcomp_ . If the substring following “
_http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/_ ” contains a “ _/_ ” character, or
any characters not legal for a library name the following action must be
taken. If _application.getProjectStage()_ is _Development_ an
informative error message must be placed in the page and also logged.
Otherwise the message must be logged only.

{empty}As specified in facelet taglibrary
schema, the runtime must also support the _<composite-library-name>_
element. The runtime must interpret the contents of this element as the
name of a resource library as described in
<<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a836,See Libraries of Localized and Versioned
Resources>>. If a facelet tag library descriptor file is encountered that
contains this element, the runtime must examine the _<namespace>_
element in that same tag library descriptor and make it available for
use in an XML namespace declaration in facelet
pages.[P1_end_composite_library_decl]

[[a5670]]
=== Creating an instance of a _top level component_

[P1_start_top_level_component_creation]If,
during the process of building the view, the facelet runtime encounters
an element in the page using the prefix for the namespace of a composite
component library, the runtime must create a _Resource_ instance with a
library property equal to the library name derived in
<<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5663,See Declaring a composite component library>>
for use in a Facelet page]and call the variant of
_application.createComponent()_ that takes a _Resource_ .

{empty}After causing the _top level
component_ to be instantiated, the runtime must create a _UIComponent_
with component-family of _jakarta.faces.Panel_ and renderer-type
_jakarta.faces.Group_ to be installed as a facet of the _top level
component_ under the facet name _UIComponent.COMPOSITE_FACET_NAME_
.[P1_end_top_level_component_creation]

=== Populating a _top level component_ instance with children

{empty}[P1_start_top_level_component_population]As
specified in <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1545,See How does one make a
composite component?>> the runtime must support the use of _composite:_
tag library in the _defining page_ pointed to by the _Resource_ derived
as specified in <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5670,See Creating an instance of
a top level component>>. [P1_start_top_level_component_population]The
runtime must ensure that all _UIComponent_ children in the _composite
component definition_ within the _defining page_ are placed as children
of the _UIComponent.COMPOSITE_FACET_NAME_ facet of the _top level
facet._ [P1_end_top_level_component_population]

Please see the tag library documentation for
the _<composite:insertChildren>_ and _<composite:insertFacet>_ tags for
details on these two tags that are relevant to populating a _top level
component_ instance with children.

Special handling is required for attributes
declared on the _composite component tag_ instance in the _using page_ .
[P1_start_composite_component_tag_attributes]The runtime must ensure
that all such attributes are copied to the attributes map of the _top
level component_ instance in the following manner.

Obtain a reference to the _ExpressionFactory_
, for discussion called _expressionFactory_ .

Let the value of the attribute in the _using
page_ be _value_ .

If _value_ is “id” or “binding” without the
quotes, skip to the next attribute.

If the value of the attribute starts with
“#\{“ (without the quotes) call
_expressionFactory.createValueExpression(elContext, value,
Object.class)_

If the value of the attribute does not start
with “ _#\{_ “, call _expressionFactory.createValueExpression(value,
Object.class)_

{empty}If there already is a key in the _map_
for _value_ , inspect the type of the value at that key. If the type is
_MethodExpression_ take no action.
[P1_end_composite_component_tag_attributes]

For code that handles tag attributes on
_UIComponent_ XHTML elements special action must be taken regarding
composite components. [P1_start_composite_component_method_expression]If
the type of the attribute is a _MethodExpression_ , the code that takes
the value of the attribute and creates an actual _MethodExpression_
instance around it must take the following special action. Inspect the
value of the attribute. If the EL expression string starts with the _cc_
implicit object, is followed by the special string “ _attrs_ ” (without
the quotes), as specified in <<ExpressionLanguageAndManagedBeanFacility.adoc#a2908,See Composite
Component Attributes ELResolver>>, and is followed by a single remaining
expression segment, let the value of that remaining expression segment
be _attrName_ . In this case, the runtime must guarantee that the actual
_MethodExpression_ instance that is created for the tag attribute have
the following behavior in its _invoke()_ method.

Obtain a reference to the current composite
component by calling _UIComponent.getCurrentCompositeComponent()_ .

Look in the attribute of the component for a
key under the value _attrName_ .

There must be a value and it must be of type
_MethodExpression_ . If either of these conditions are _false_ allow the
ensuing exception to be thrown.

{empty}Call _invoke()_ on the discovered
_MethodExpression_ , passing the arguments passed to our _invoke()_
method.[P1_end_composite_component_method_expression]

[P1_start_composite_component_retargeting]Once
the composite component has been populated with children, the runtime
must ensure that _ViewHandler.retargetAttachedObjects()_ and then
_ViewHandler.retargetMethodExpressions()_ is called, passing the _top
level component_ .[P1_end_composite_component_retargeting] The actions
taken in these methods set the stage for the tag attribute behavior and
the special _MethodExpression_ handling behavior described previously.

[P1_start_nested_composite_components]The
runtime must support the inclusion of composite components within the
_composite component definition_ . [P1_end_nested_composite_components].


[[a5691]]
=== Standard Facelet Tag Libraries

This section specifies the tag libraries that
must be provided by an implementation.

=== JSF Core Tag Library

This tag library must be equivalent to the
one specified in <<IntegrationWithJSP.adoc#a4636,See JSF Core Tag Library>>.

For all of the tags that correspond to
attached objects, the Facelets implementation supportes an additional
attribute, _for_ , which is intended for use when the attached object
tag exists within a composite component. If present, this attribute
refers to the value of one of the exposed attached objects within the
composite component inside of which this tag is nested.

The following additional tags apply to the
Facelet Core Tag Library only.

[[a1111]]
=== <f:ajax>

This tag serves two roles depending on its
placement. If this tag is nested within a single component, it will
associate an Ajax action with that component. If this tag is placed
around a group of components it will associate an Ajax action with all
components that support the “events” attribute. In there is an outer

=== Syntax

<f:ajax [event=”Literal”] [execute=”Literal |
Value Expression”] [render=”Literal | Value Expression”]
[onevent=”Literal | Value Expression”] [onerror=”Literal | Value
Expression”] | [listener=”Method Expression”] [disabled=”Literal|Value
Expression”] [immediate=”Literal|ValueExpression]/>

=== Body Content

empty.

=== Attributes

The following optional attributes are
available:

===

Name

Expr

Type

Description

event

String

String

A String identifying the type of event the
Ajax action will apply to. If specified, it must be one of the events
supported by the component the Ajax behavior is being applied to. If not
specified, the default event is determined for the component. The
default event is “action” for ActionSource components and “valueChange”
for EditableValueHolder components.

execute

VE

Collection<String>

If a literal is specified, it must be a space
delimited String of component identifiers and/or one of the keywords
outlined in <<JavaScriptAPI.adoc#a6884,See Keywords>>. If not
specified, then @this is the default. If a ValueExpression is specified,
it must refer to a property that returns a Collection of Strings. Each
String in the Collection must not contain spaces.

render

VE

Collection<String>

If a literal is specified, it must be a space
delimited String of component identifiers and/or one of the keywords
outlined in <<JavaScriptAPI.adoc#a6884,See Keywords>>. If not
specified, then @none is the default . If a ValueExpression is
specified, it must refer to a property that returns a Collection of
Strings. Each String in the Collection must not contain spaces.

onevent

VE

String

The name of a JavaScript function that will
handle events

onerror

VE

String

The name of a JavaScript function that will
handle errors.

disabled

VE

boolean

“false” indicates the Ajax behavior script
should be rendered; “true” indicates the Ajax behavior script should not
be rendered. “false” is the default.

listener

ME

MethodExpression

The listener method to execute when Ajax
requests are processed on he server.

immediate

VE

boolean

If “true” behavior events generated from this
behavior are broadcast during Apply Request Values phase. Otherwise, the
events will be broadcast during Invoke Aplications phase.

=== Specifying “execute”/”render” Identifiers

{empty}The String value for identifiers
specified for execute and render may be specified as a search expression
as outlined in the JavaDocs for UIComponent.findComponent.
[P1_start_execrenderIds]The implementation must resolve these
identifiers as specified for UIComponent.findComponent.[P1_end]

=== Constraints

This tag may be nested within any of the
standard HTML components. It may also be nested within any custom
component that implements the ClientBehaviorHolder interface. Refer to
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1707,See Component
Behavior Model>> for more information about this interface.
[P1_start_ajaxtag_events]A TagAttibuteException must be thrown if an
“event” attribute value is specified that does not match the events
supported by the component type. [P1_end_ajaxtag_events] For example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:commandButton ..>

<f:ajax event=”valueChange”/>

</h:commandButton id=”button1” ...>

|===

{empty}An attempt is made to apply a
“valueChange” Ajax event to an “action” component. This is invalid and
the Ajax behavior will not be applied. [P1_start_bevent]The event
attribute that is specified, must be one of the events returned from the
ClientBehaviorHolder component implementation of
ClientBehaviorHolder.getEventNames. If an event is not specified the
value returned from the component implementation of
ClientBehaviorHolder.getDefaultEventName must be used. If the event is
still not determined, a TagAttributeException must be thrown.[P1_end]

This tag may also serve to “ajaxify” regions
of a page by nesting a group of components within it:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax>

<h:panelGrid>

<h:inputText id=”text1”/>

<h:commandButton id=”button1”/>

</h:panelGrid>

</f:ajax>

|===

From this example, “text1” and “button1” will
have ajax behavior applied to them. The default events for these
components would cause Ajax requests to fire. For “text1” a
“valueChange” event would apply and for “button1” an “action” event
would apply. <h:panelGrid> has no default event so in this case a
behavior would not be applied.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax event=”click”>

<h:panelGrid id=”grid1”>

<h:inputText id=”text1”/>

<h:commandButton id=”button1”>

<f:ajax event=”mouseover”/>

</h:commandButton>

</h:panelGrid>

</f:ajax>

|===

From this example, “grid1” and “text1” would
have ajax behavior applied for an “onclick” event. “button1” would have
ajax behavior applied for both “mouseover” and “onclick” events. The
“oncick” event is a supported event type for PanelGrid components.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax>

<h:commandButton id=”button1”>

<f:ajax/>

</h:commandButton>

</f:ajax>

|===

For this example, the inner <f:ajax/> would
apply to “button1”. The outer (wrapping) <f:ajax> would not be applied,
since it is the same type of submitting behavior (AjaxBehavior) and the
same event type (action).

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax event=”click”>

<h:inputText id=”text1”>

<f:ajax event=”click”/>

</h:inputText>

</f:ajax>

|===

For this example, since the event types are
the same, the inner <f:ajax> event overrides the outer one.



[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax event=”action”>

<h:commandButton id=”button1”>

<b:greet event=”action”/>

</h:commandButton>

</f:ajax>

|===

Here, there is a custom behavior “greet”
attached to “button1”. the outer <f:ajax> Ajax behavior will also get
applied to “button1”. But it will be applied *after* the “greet”
behavior.

=== Description

Enable one or more components in the view to
perform Ajax operations. This tag handler must create an instance of
jakarta.faces.component.behavior.AjaxBehavior instance using the tag
attribute values. If this tag is nested within a single
ClientBehaviorHolder component:

If the event attribute is not specified,
determine the event by calling the component’s getDefaultEventName
method. If that returns null, throw an exception.

If the event attribute is specified, ensure
that it is a valid event - that is one of the events contained in the
Collection returned from getEventNames method. If it does not exist in
this Collection, throw an exception.

Add the AjaxBehavior to the component by
calling the addBehavior method, passing the event and AjaxBehavior
instance.

If this tag is wrapped around component
children add the AjaxBehavior instance to the data structure holding the
behaviors for that component. As subsequent child components that
implement the BehaviorHolder interface are evaluated, this AjaxBehavior
instance must be added as a Behavior to the component. Please refer to
the Javadocs for the core tag handler AjaxHandler for additional
requirements.

=== Examples

Apply Ajax to “button1” and “text1”:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax>

<h:form>

<h:commandButton id=”button1” ...>

<h:inputText id=”text1” ..>

</h:form>

</f:ajax>

|===

Apply Ajax to “text1”:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax event=”valueChange”>

<h:form>

<h:commandButton id=”button1” ...>

<h:inputText id=”text1” ..>

</h:form>

</f:ajax>

|===

Apply Ajax to “button1”:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax event=”action”>

<h:form>

<h:commandButton id=”button1” ...>

<h:inputText id=”text1” ..>

</h:form>

</f:ajax>

|===

Override default Ajax action. “button1” is
associated with the Ajax “execute=’cancel’” action:[[a5815]]

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:ajax event=”action” execute=”reset”>

<h:form>

<h:commandButton id=”button1” ...>

<f:ajax execute=”cancel”/>

</h:commandButton>

<h:inputText id=”text1” ..>

</h:form>

</f:ajax>

|===

=== <f:event>

Allow JSF page authors to install
_ComponentSystemEventListener_ instances on a component in a page.
Because this tag is closely tied to the event system, please see section
<<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1393,See Declarative Listener Registration>> for
the normative specification.

=== <f:metadata>

Register a facet on the parent component,
which must be the _UIViewRoot_ . This must be a child of the _<f:view>_
. This tag must reside within the top level XHTML file for the given
viewId, not in a template. The implementation must ensure that the
direct child of the facet is a _UIPanel_ , even if there is only one
child of the facet. The implementation must set the id of the _UIPanel_
to be the value of the _UIViewRoot.METADATA_FACET_NAME_ symbolic
constant.

[[a5828]]
=== <f:validateBean>

Register a BeanValidator instance on the
parent EditableValueHolder UIComponent or the EditableValueHolder
UIComponent whose client id matches the value of the "for" attribute
when used within a composite component. If neither criteria is
satisfied, save the validation groups in an attribute on the parent
UIComponent to be used as defaults inherited by any BeanValidator in
that branch of the component tree. Don't save the validation groups
string if it is null or empty string. If the validationGroups attribute
is not defined on this tag when used in an EditableValueHolder, or the
value of the attribute is empty string, attempt to inherit the
validation groups from the nearest parent component on which a set of
validation groups is stored. If no validation groups are inherited,
assume the Default validation group, jakarta.validation.groups.Default. If
the BeanValidator is one of the default validators, then this tag simply
specializes the validator by providing the list of validation groups to
be used. There are two usage patterns for this tag, both shown below.
The tags surrounding and nested within the _<f:validateBean>_ tag, as
well as the attributes of the tag itself, are show for illustrative
purposes only.

Syntax

_<h:inputText value=”#\{model.property}”> +
<f:validateBean validationGroups= +
"jakarta.validation.groups.Default,app.validation.groups.Order"/> +
</h:inputText>_

or

_<h:form> +
<f:validateBean> +
<h:inputText value=”#\{model.property}” /> +
<h:selectOneRadio value=”#\{model.radioProperty}” > ...
</h:selectOneRadio> +
_ <!-- other input components here --> +
</f:validateBean> +
</h:form>

=== Body Content

Empty in the case when the Bean Validator is
to be registered on a parent component.

Filled with input components when the Bean
Validator is to be set on all of the ensclosing input components.

Constraints

Must be nested in an EditableValueHolder or
nested in a composite component and have a for attribute. Otherwise, it
simply defines enables or disables the validator as a default for the
branch of the component tree under the parent component and/or sets the
validation group defaults for the branch. No exception is thrown if one
of the first two conditions are not met, unlike other standard
validators.

Description

Must use or extend the
_jakarta.faces.view.facelets.ValidatorHandler_ class

If not within an EditableValueHolder or
composite component, store the validation groups as defaults for the
current branch of the component tree, but only if the value is a
non-empty string.

If the disabled attribute is true, the
validator should not be added. In addition, the validatorId, if present,
should be added to an exclusion list on the parent component to prevent
a default validator with the same id from being registered on the
component.

The createValidator() method must:

If binding is non-null, create a
ValueExpression by invoking Application.createValueExpression() with
binding as the expression argument, and Validator.class as the
expectedType argument. Use the ValueExpression to obtain a reference to
the Validator instance. If there is no exception thrown, and
ValueExpression.getValue() returned a non-null object that implements
jakarta.faces.validator.Validator, it must then cast the returned instance
to jakarta.faces.validator.BeanValidator, configure its properties based
on the specified attributes, and return the configured instance. If
there was an exception thrown, rethrow the exception as a TagException.

Use the validatorId if the validator instance
could not be created from the binding attribute. Call the
createValidator() method of the Application instance for this
application, passing validator id "jakarta.faces.Bean". If the binding
attribute was also set, evaluate the expression into a ValueExpression
and store the validator instance by calling setValue() on the
ValueExpression. It must then cast the returned instance to
jakarta.faces.validator.BeanValidator, configure its properties based on
the specified attributes, and return the configured instance. If there
was an exception thrown, rethrow the exception as a TagException.

[[a5857]]
=== <f:validateRequired>

Register a RequiredValidator instance on the
parent EditableValueHolder UIComponent or the EditableValueHolder
UIComponent whose client id matches the value of the "for" attribute
when used within a composite component.

Use the validatorId if the validator instance
could not be created from the binding attribute. Call the
createValidator() method of the Application instance for this
application, passing validator id "jakarta.faces.Required". If the binding
attribute was also set, evaluate the expression into a ValueExpression

messages can be sent from server side via _jakarta.faces.push.PushContext_
interface which is injected into a using class with the
_@jakarta.faces.push.Push_ CDI qualifier.

<TODO - Tip>
<f:websocket> is designed for push from server to client

Although W3C WebSocket supports two-way
communication, the <f:websocket> push is designed for one-way
communication, from server to client. In case you intend to send some
data from client to server, continue using JSF ajax the usual way. This
has among others the advantage of maintaining the JSF view state, the
HTTP session and, critically, all security constraints on business
service methods.

=== Syntax

_<f:websocket [binding=_ " _ValueExpression_
" _] [id=_ " _Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] +
channel=_ " _Literal_ " _[scope=_ " _Literal_ " _] [user=_ "
_Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] +
[onopen=_ " _Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] [onmessage=_ "
_Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] +
[onclose=_ " _Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] [connected=_ "
_Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] +
[rendered=_ " _Literal|ValueExpression_ " _] />_

=== Body Content

Empty, or one or more _<f:ajax>_ tags with
the _event_ attribute set to exactly the push message content.

=== Attributes

The following required attribute must be set:

===

Name

Expr

Type

Description

channel

String

String

The name of the websocket channel. It may not
be an EL expression and it may only contain alphanumeric characters,
hyphens, underscores and periods. All open websockets on the same
channel name will receive the same push notification from the server.

The following optional attributes are
available:

===

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Exp
|Type |Description
|id |VE
|String |Component
identifier of the _UIWebSocket_ component to be created.

|scope |String
|String |The scope
of the websocket channel. It may not be an EL expression and allowed
values are _application_ , _session_ and _view_ , case insensitive. When
the value is _application_ , then all channels with the same name
throughout the application will receive the same push message. When the
value is _session_ , then only the channels with the same name in the
current user session will receive the same push message. When the value
is _view_ , then only the channel in the current view will receive the
push message. The default scope is _application_ . When the _user_
attribute is specified, then the default scope is _session_ .

|user |VE
|Serializable |The
user identifier of the websocket channel, so that user-targeted push
messages can be sent. It must implement Serializable and preferably have
low memory footprint. Suggestion: use #\{request.remoteUser} or
#\{someLoggedInUser.id}. All open websockets on the same channel and
user will receive the same push message from the server.

|onopen |VE
|String |The
JavaScript event handler function that is invoked when the websocket is
opened. The function will be invoked with one argument: the channel
name.

|onmessage |VE
|String |The
JavaScript event handler function that is invoked when a push message is
received from the server. The function will be invoked with three
arguments: the push message, the channel name and the raw MessageEvent
itself.

|onclose |VE
|String |The
JavaScript event handler function that is invoked when the websocket is
closed. The function will be invoked with three arguments: the close
reason code, the channel name and the raw CloseEvent itself. Note that
this will also be invoked on errors and that you can inspect the close
reason code if an error occurred and which one (i.e. when the code is
not 1000). See also RFC 6455 section 7.4.1 and
jakarta.websocket.CloseReason.CloseCodes API for an elaborate list of all
close codes.

|connected |VE
|Boolean |Whether
to (auto)connect the websocket or not. Defaults to true. It's
interpreted as a JavaScript instruction whether to open or close the
websocket push connection. This attribute is implicitly re-evaluated on
every ajax request by a PreRenderViewEvent listener on the UIViewRoot.
You can also explicitly set it to false and then manually control in
JavaScript by jsf.push.open(clientId) and jsf.push.close(clientId).

|rendered |VE
|Boolean |Whether
to render the websocket scripts or not. Defaults to true. This attribute
is implicitly re-evaluated on every ajax request by a PreRenderViewEvent
listener on the UIViewRoot. If the value changes to false while the
websocket is already opened, then the websocket will implicitly be
closed.

|binding |VE
|UIComponent
|Value binding expression to a backing bean
property bound to the component instance for the UIComponent created by
this tag.
|===

=== Configuration

First, enable the websocket endpoint using
the context parameter:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<context-param> +
<param-name>jakarta.faces.ENABLE_WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT</param-name> +
<param-value>true</param-value> +
</context-param>
|===

In case your server is configured to run a
WebSocket container on a different TCP port than the HTTP container,
then you can use the optional jakarta.faces.WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT_PORT
integer context parameter in web.xml to explicitly specify the port.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<context-param> +
<param-name>jakarta.faces.WEBSOCKET_ENDPOINT_PORT</param-name> +
<param-value>8000</param-value> +
</context-param>
|===

=== Usage (client)

Declare <f:websocket> tag in the JSF view
with at least a channel name and an onmessage JavaScript listener
function. The channel name may not be an EL expression and it may only
contain alphanumeric characters, hyphens, underscores and periods.

Here's an example which refers an existing
JavaScript listener function.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:websocket channel="someChannel" +
onmessage="someWebsocketListener" /> +
 +
function someWebsocketListener(message, channel, event) \{

 console.log(message);

}



|===

Here’s an example which declares an inline
JavaScript listener function.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket channel="someChannel" +
onmessage="function(m)\{console.log(m);}" />
|===

The onmessage JavaScript listener function
will be invoked with three arguments:

message: the push message as JSON object.

channel: the channel name.

event: the raw MessageEvent instance.

When successfully connected, the websocket is
by default open as long as the document is open, and it will
auto-reconnect at increasing intervals when the connection is
closed/aborted as result of e.g. a network error or server restart. It
will not auto-reconnect when the very first connection attempt already
fails. The websocket will be implicitly closed once the document is
unloaded.

=== Usage (server)

On the Java programming side, you can inject
a PushContext via @Push annotation on the given channel name in any
CDI/container managed artifact, such as @Named, @WebServlet, wherever
you'd like to send a push message and then invoke
PushContext.send(Object) with any Java object representing the push
message.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|@Inject @Push +
private PushContext someChannel; +
 +
public void sendMessage(Object message) \{ +
someChannel.send(message); +
}
|===

By default the name of the channel is taken
from the name of the variable into which injection takes place.

The channel name can be optionally specified
via the channel attribute. The example below injects the push context
for channel name foo into a variable named bar.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|@Inject @Push(channel="foo") +
private PushContext bar;
|===

The message object will be encoded as JSON
and be delivered as message argument of the onmessage JavaScript
listener function associated with the channel name. It can be a plain
vanilla String, but it can also be a collection, map and even a Java
bean.

=== Scopes and Users

By default the websocket is application
scoped, i.e. any view/session throughout the web application having the
same websocket channel open will receive the same push message. The push
message can be sent by all users and the application itself.

The optional scope attribute can be set to
session to restrict the push messages to all views in the current user
session only. The push message can only be sent by the user itself and
not by the application.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket channel="someChannel"
scope="session" ... />
|===

The scope attribute can also be set to view
to restrict the push messages to the current view only. The push message
will not show up in other views in the same session even if it's the
same URL. The push message can only be sent by the user itself and not
by the application..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket channel="someChannel"
scope="view" ... />
|===

The scope attribute may not be an EL
expression and allowed values are _application_ , _session_ and _view_ ,
case insensitive.

Additionally, the optional user attribute can
be set to the unique identifier of the logged-in user, usually the login
name or the user ID. This way the push message can be targeted to a
specific user and can also be sent by other users and the application
itself. The value of the user attribute must at least implement
Serializable and have a low memory footprint, so an entire user entity
is not recommended.

E.g. when you're using container managed
authentication or a related framework/library:.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket channel="someChannel" +
user="#\{request.remoteUser}" ... />
|===

Or when you have a custom user entity
accessible via EL, such as as #\{someLoggedInUser} which has an id
property representing its identifier:.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket channel="someChannel" +
user="#\{someLoggedInUser.id}" ... />
|===

When the user attribute is specified, then
the scope defaults to session and cannot be set to application.

On the server side, the push message can be
targeted to the user specified in the user attribute via
PushContext.send(Object, Serializable). The push message can be sent by
all users and the application itself..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|@Inject @Push +
private PushContext someChannel; +
 +
public void sendMessage(Object message, User recipientUser) \{ +
Long recipientUserId = recipientUser.getId(); +
someChannel.send(message, recipientUserId); +
}
|===

Multiple users can be targeted by passing a
Collection holding user identifiers to PushContext.send(Object,
Collection)..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void sendMessage(Object message,
Group recipientGroup) \{ +
Collection<Long> recipientUserIds = +
recipientGroup.getUserIds(); +
someChannel.send(message, recipientUserIds); +
}
|===

=== Conditionally Connecting

You can use the optional connected attribute
to control whether to auto-connect the websocket or not..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket ...
connected="#\{bean.pushable}" />
|===

The _connected_ attribute defaults to true
and is interpreted as a JavaScript instruction whether to open or close
the websocket push connection. If the value is an EL expression and it
becomes false during an ajax request, then the push connection will
explicitly be closed during _oncomplete_ of that ajax request.

You can also explicitly set it to false and
manually open the push connection in client side by invoking
jsf.push.open(clientId), passing the component's client ID..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<h:commandButton ...
onclick="jsf.push.open('foo')"> +
<f:ajax ... /> +
</h:commandButton> +
<f:websocket id="foo" channel="bar" scope="view" ... +
connected="false" />
|===

In case you intend to have an one-time push
and don’t expect more messages, you can optionally explicitly close the
push connection from client side by invoking jsf.push.close(clientId),
passing the component’s client ID. For example, in the onmessage
JavaScript listener function as below:.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|function someWebsocketListener(message) \{ +
// ... +
jsf.push.close('foo'); +
}
|===

=== Events (client)

The optional onopen JavaScript listener
function can be used to listen on open of a websocket in client side.
This will be invoked on the very first connection attempt, regardless of
whether it will be successful or not. This will not be invoked when the
websocket auto-reconnects a broken connection after the first successful
connection.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket ...
onopen="websocketOpenListener" /> +
 +
function websocketOpenListener(channel) \{ +
// ... +
}
|===

The _onopen_ JavaScript listener function
will be invoked with one argument:

channel: the channel name, useful in case you
intend to have a global listener.

The optional onclose JavaScript listener
function can be used to listen on a normal or abnormal close of a
websocket. This will be invoked when the very first connection attempt
fails, or the server has returned close reason code 1000 (normal
closure) or 1008 (policy violated), or the maximum reconnect attempts
has been exceeded. This will not be invoked when the websocket can make
an auto-reconnect attempt on a broken connection after the first
successful connection

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<f:websocket ...
onclose="websocketCloseListener" /> +
 +
function websocketCloseListener(code, channel, event) \{ +
if (code == -1) \{ +
// Websockets not supported by client. +
} else if (code == 1000) \{ +
// Normal close (as result of expired session or view). +
} else \{ +
// Abnormal close reason (as result of an error). +
} +
}
|===

The _onclose_ JavaScript listener function
will be invoked with three arguments:

code: the close reason code as integer. If
this is -1, then the websocket is simply not supported by the client. If
this is 1000, then it was normally closed. Otherwise, if this is not
1000, then there may be an error. See also RFC 6455 section 7.4.1 and
jakarta.websocket.CloseReason.CloseCodes API for an elaborate list of all
close codes.

channel: the channel name.

event: the raw CloseEvent instance.

When a session or view scoped socket is
automatically closed with close reason code 1000 by the server (and thus
not manually by the client via jsf.push.close(clientId)), then it means
that the session or view has expired.

=== Events (server)

When a session or view scoped socket is
automatically closed with close reason code 1000 by the server (and thus
not manually by the client via jsf.push.close(clientId)), then it means
that the session or view has expired.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
@ApplicationScoped +
public class WebsocketObserver \{ +
 +
public void onOpen(@Observes @Opened WebsocketEvent event) \{ +
String channel = event.getChannel(); +
// Returns <f:websocket channel>. +
Long userId = event.getUser(); +
// Returns <f:websocket user>, if any. +
// ... +
} +
 +
public void onClose(@Observes @Closed WebsocketEvent event) \{ +
String channel = event.getChannel(); +
// Returns <f:websocket channel>. +
Long userId = event.getUser();

 // Returns <f:websocket user>, if any. +
CloseCode code = event.getCloseCode(); +
// Returns close reason code. +
// ... +
}

|===

=== Security Considerations

If the socket is declared in a page which is
only restricted to logged-in users with a specific role, then you may
want to add the URL of the push handshake request URL to the set of
restricted URLs.



The push handshake request URL is composed of
the URI prefix /jakarta.faces.push/, followed by channel name. In the
example of container managed security which has already restricted an
example page /user/foo.xhtml to logged-in users with the example role
USER on the example URL pattern /user/* in web.xml like below,

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<security-constraint> +
<web-resource-collection> +
<web-resource-name>Restrict access to role USER. +
</web-resource-name> +
<url-pattern>/user/*</url-pattern> +
</web-resource-collection> +
<auth-constraint> +
<role-name>USER</role-name> +
</auth-constraint> +
</security-constraint>
|===

and the page /user/foo.xhtml in turn contains
a <f:websocket channel="foo">, then you need to add a restriction on
push handshake request URL pattern of _/jakarta.faces.push/foo_ as shown
next.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<security-constraint> +
<web-resource-collection> +
<web-resource-name>Restrict access to role USER. +
</web-resource-name> +
<url-pattern>/user/*</url-pattern> +
<url-pattern>/jakarta.faces.push/foo</url-pattern> +
</web-resource-collection> +
<auth-constraint> +
<role-name>USER</role-name> +
</auth-constraint> +
</security-constraint>
|===

As extra security, particularly for those
public channels which can’t be restricted by security constraints, the
<f:websocket> will register all so previously declared channels in the
current HTTP session, and any incoming websocket open request will be
checked whether they match these channels in the current HTTP session.
In case the channel is unknown (e.g. randomly guessed or spoofed by end
users or manually reconnected after the session is expired), then the
websocket will immediately be closed with close reason code
CloseCodes.VIOLATED_POLICY (1008). Also, when the HTTP session gets
destroyed, all session and view scoped channels which are still open
will explicitly be closed from server side with close reason code
CloseCodes.NORMAL_CLOSURE (1000). Only application scoped sockets remain
open and are still reachable from server end even when the session or
view associated with the page in client side is expired.

=== Ajax Support

In case you’d like to perform complex UI
updates depending on the received push message, then you can nest
<f:ajax> inside <f:websocket>. Here’s an example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<h:panelGroup id="foo"> +
... (some complex UI here) ... +
</h:panelGroup> +
 +
<h:form> +
<f:websocket channel="someChannel" scope="view"> +
<f:ajax event="someEvent" +
listener="#\{bean.pushed}" render=":foo" /> +
</f:websocket> +
</h:form>
|===

Here, the push message simply represents the
ajax event name. You can use any custom event name.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|someChannel.send("someEvent");
|===

An alternative is to combine <f:websocket>
with <h:commandScript>. The <f:websocket onmessage> can reference
exactly the <h:commandScript name>. For example,

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|<h:panelGroup id="foo"> +
... (some complex UI here) ... +
</h:panelGroup> +
<f:websocket channel="someChannel" scope="view" +
onmessage="pushed" /> +
<h:form> +
<h:commandScript name="pushed" +
action="#\{bean.pushed}" render=":foo" /> +
</h:form>
|===

If you pass a Map<String,V> or a JavaBean as
push message object, then all entries/properties will transparently be
available as request parameters in the command script method
#\{bean.pushed}.

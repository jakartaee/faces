[.footnoteNumber]# 1.# [[a9083]]Typically, component
selection will be driven by the occurrence of special markup (such as
the existence of aJakarta Server Pagescustom tag) in the template text associated with
the component tree.

[.footnoteNumber]# 2.# [[a9084]]For example, this
technique is used when custom tags inJakarta Server Pagespages are utilized as the
rendering technology, as described in <<a4406,
Integration with JSP>>.

[.footnoteNumber]# 3.# [[a9085]]The default
_ViewHandler_ implementation performs a _RequestDispatcher.forward_ call
to the web application resource that will actually perform the
rendering, so it expects the tree identifier to be the context-relative
path (starting with a _/_ character) of the web application resource

[.footnoteNumber]# 4.# [[a9086]]In aJakarta Server Pagesenvironment,
these steps are performed by a custom tag extending ConverterTag.

[.footnoteNumber]# 5.# [[a9087]]Accessing attributes
via this Map will cause the creation of a session associated with this
request, if none currently exists.

[.footnoteNumber]# 6.# [[a9088]]Converters can also be
requested based on the object class of the value to be converted.

[.footnoteNumber]# 7.# [[a9089]]It is an error to
specify more than one <navigation-case>, nested within one or more
<navigation-rule> elements with the same <from-view-id> matching
pattern, that have exactly the same combination of <from-xxx>, unless
each is discriminated by a unique <if> element.

[.footnoteNumber]# 8.# [[a9090]]The presence of the
<if> element in the absense of the <from-outcome> element is
characterized as an alternate, contextual means of obtai

ning a logical outcome and thus the
navigation case is checked even when the application action returns a a
null (or void) outcome value.

[.footnoteNumber]# 9.# [[a9092]]Note that multiple
conditions can be checked using the built-in operators and grouping
provided by the Expression Language (e.g., and, or, not).

[.footnoteNumber]# 10.# [[a9093]]Or, equivalently,
with no _<from-view-id>_ element at all.

[.footnoteNumber]# 11.# [[a9094]]The implementation
classes for attached object must include a public zero-arguments
constructor.

[.footnoteNumber]# 12.# [[a9095]]The actual _Method_
selected for execution must be selected as if by calling
Class.getMethod() and passing the method name and the parameters
signature specified in the createMethodBinding() call.

[.footnoteNumber]# 13.# [[a9096]]If this extension is
used, it must be declared in the web application deployment descriptor,
as described in theJakarta Server Pages2.0 (or later) specification.

[.footnoteNumber]# 14.# [[a9097]]This example
illustrates a non-normative convention for naming custom actions based
on a combination of the component name and the renderer type. This
convention is useful, but not required; custom actions may be given any
desired custom action name; however the convention is rigorously
followed in the Standard HTML RenderKit Tag Library.

[.footnoteNumber]# 15.# [[a9098]]Consistent with the
way that namespace prefixes work in XML, the actual prefix used is
totally up to the page author, and has no semantic meaning. However, the
values shown above are the suggested defaults, which are used
consistently in tag library examples throughout this specification.

[.footnoteNumber]# 16.# [[a9099]]If you need multiple
components in a facet, nest them inside a <h:panelGroup> custom action
that is the value of the facet.

[.footnoteNumber]# 17.# [[a9100]]In aJakarta Server Pages2.0 or later
environment, the same effect can be accomplished by using
<include-prelude> and <include-coda> elements in the <jsp-config>
element in the web application deployment descriptor.

[.footnoteNumber]# 18.# [[a9101]]This component has no
associated Renderer, so the getRendererType() method must return null
instead of a renderer type.

[.footnoteNumber]# 19.# [[a9102]]Identified by XPath
selection expressions.

ViewDeclarationLanguage instance. If the result is non-null, call
createMetadataView() on the ViewMetadata instance. Call
ViewMetadata.getViewParameters(). If the result is a non-empty

UIViewRoot.METADATA_FACET_NAME. This facet must exist. If the facet has
no children, call facesContext.renderResponse(). Otherwise, none of the
previous steps have yielded the discovery any of metadata, so call
facesContext.renderResponse().

==== Backward Compatibility with Previous Versions

Faces 2.2 is backwards compatible with Faces
2.1 and 2.0. This means that a web-application that was developed to run
with Faces 2.1 or 2.0 won’t require any modification when run with Faces
2.2 except in the cases described in the following section.

==== Breakages in Backward Compatibility

* Issue ID {issue_tracker_url}1092[1092] +
Due to an error in previous versions of the
specification, exceptions were silently being swallowed that now will
bubble up to the exception handler. Code that was relying on this
incorrect behavior may need to be modified to account for fixing this
problem.

exception of the __getValue("type")__. The return type from
_getValue("type")_ must be __Class__. If the value specified for the
_type_ attribute of _<cc:attribute/>_ cannot be converted to an actual
__Class__, a _TagAttributeException_ must be thrown, including the _Tag_
and _TagAttribute_ instances in the constructor.
--

Yes, this is a backwards incompatible change,
but because the usecase is so specific, and the performance benefit so
substantial, it was judged to be worth the cost.




=== Changes between 2.0 Rev a and 2.1

==== <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5638,Facelet Tag Library mechanism>>

Document that the unprefixed namespace must
pass through.

==== New feature: <facelets-processing>

See <<FacesMetadata.adoc#a7040,
Required Handling of *-extension elements in the application
configuration resources files>>

==== Update schema for 2.1

The only new element is
<facelet-cache-factory>. See the full schema in the Javadoc section of
the documents.

==== Change Restore View Phase

Change <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a404,
Restore View>> to require a call to _ViewHandler.deriveLogicalViewId()_
before trying to find the __ViewDeclarationLanguage__.

==== <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3910,Default ViewHandler Implementation>>

Document _deriveLogicalViewId()._


=== Changes between 2.0 Final and 2.0 Rev a

==== Global changes

===== ExceptionQueuedEvent

The specification incorrectly refers to the
ExceptionQueuedEvent as the ExceptionEvent. All instances should be
replaced, as there is no such class ExceptionEvent in JSF.

===== Usage of the term "page" in the JSF 2.0 spec

This might be kind of nit-picky, but there
are several occurrences of the term "Facelet page" in the JSF 2.0 spec,
but I'd like to set forth the argument that the term "Facelet document"
or "Facelet view" would be more appropriate, depending on context.
Similarly, the spec uses the term "Composite component markup page"
which isn't always appropriate either. Better to call it a "Composite
component markup document" or something like that.

All Facelet XHTML files are documents, but
not all Facelet XHTML files are pages. There is a built-in bias to the
word "page" that assumes the markup output will be rendered as a "web
page" which is not always the case. In the case of portlets, the
rendered output is a fragment of markup (normally a <div>...</div>). In
the case of a custom renderkit, the rendered output might be some mobile
device. In the case of ICEfaces, the rendered markup is a server-side
DOM tree. In the case of a composite component, a Facelet XHTML file is
not a page, but a "Composite Component markup document" (or definition)
file.

For example.. Instead of a "Facelet Page", I
think the following should be called a "Facelet Document" or a "Facelet
View" (since the f:view tag is optional, but implied)

[source,xml]
----
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:f="jakarta.faces.core"
      xmlns:h="jakarta.faces.html">
  <h:head>
    ...
  </h:head>
  <h:body>
    ...
  </h:body>
</html>
----

But in the case of Portlets, the <html> ,
<head>, and <body> tags are forbidden. The equivalent "Facelet Document"
or "Facelet View" for portlets would look like this:

[source,xml]
----
<f:view xmlns:f="jakarta.faces.core"
        xmlns:h="jakarta.faces.html">
  ...
</f:view>
----

==== Front Matter

Change Sun logo to Oracle Logo. Sun postal
address to Oracle postal address, and Sun phone number to Oracle phone
number

Update spec license.

==== Chapter 2

===== <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a404,Restore View>>

Per Andy Schwartz recommendation, loosen the
spec requirements for the delivery of the PostRestoreStateEvent to be
"somewhere during RestoreView".

===== <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a584,Localized Application Messages>>

Suggestion: Change to

Validation Error: Length is less than
allowable minimum of 5.

===== <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a710,JSR 303 Bean Validation>>

Change "leas" to "least"

===== <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a710,JSR 303 Bean Validation>> needs to reference "Bean Validation Integration" section

While reading section 2.5.7, one becomes very
disappointed with the limited about of information that it provides. But
section 3.5.6 provides more information, so the recommendation is that
these sections reference each other, or perhaps are combined in some way
if that makes sense.

===== <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a758,Resource Identifiers>>

Tighten spec for the localePrefix,
libraryName, and resourceVersion segments of the resource identifier.

==== Chapter 3

===== Clarify meaning of "javax.faces.bean" in <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1464,Bean Validator Activation>>

Section 3.5.6.1 says:

"If Bean Validation is present in the runtime
environment, the system must ensure that the javax.faces.Bean standard
validator is added with a call to Application.addDefaultValidatorId()"

But the reader of the Spec has no idea what
the "javax.faces.Bean" standard validator is, within the context of this
paragraph. Recommend adding some verbiage that says that
javax.faces.Bean is the validatorId of the standard JSR 303 validator of
the JSF 2.0 API, which equates to the
javax.faces.validator.BeanValidator class as mentioned in Section
10.4.1.4.

===== Need to be consistent between <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1393,Declarative Listener Registration>> of the JSF 2.0 Spec and the VDLDoc for f:event

Section 3.4.3.4 of the JSF 2.0 Spec reads:

The method signature for the MethodExpression
pointed to by the listener attribute must match the signature of

javax.faces.event.ComponentSystemEventListener.processEvent().

And the VDLDocs for f:event read:

(signature must match public void
listener(javax.faces.event.ComponentSystemEvent event) throws
javax.faces.event.AbortProcessingException)

Both of these are true, and indeed saying the
same thing. But I think it would be helpful to say BOTH things, in BOTH
documents.

===== Typo in <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1393,Declarative Listener Registration>> of the JSF 2.0 Spec regarding "beforeRender"

Section 3.4.3.4 of the JSF 2.0 Spec has this
example:

[source,xml]
----
<h:inputText value="#{myBean.text}">
  <f:event type="beforeRender" listener="#{myBean.beforeTextRender}" />
</h:inputText>
----

But "beforeRender" is a typo. The correct
value is "preRenderComponent" as stated in the f:event VDLDocs.

===== <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1419,Validation Registration>>, <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1518,What does it mean to be a JSF User Interface component?>>

Remove references to UInput.encodeEnd(). Not
for a very long time has this method been used to instigate validation.

===== <<UserInterfaceComponentModel.adoc#a1671,Composite Component Metadata>>

Section 3.6.2.1 of the Spec indicates that
the "hidden" property of the javax.bean.FeatureDescriptor is to appear
as an attribute for tags like cc:actionSource,
cc:attribute, cc:facet, and cc:interface but the
VDLDocs do not declare that the "hidden" property is available.

==== Chapter 4

===== <<StandardUserInterfaceComponents.adoc#a2268,Events>>

Remove text pertaining to
PostRestoreStateEvent, rely instead on text in setion 2.2.1.

==== Chapter 7

===== <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3562,Overview>>

getNavigationCase should return
NavigationCase and not void.

===== <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3571,Default NavigationHandler Algorithm>>

Add faces-include-view-params

===== <<ApplicationIntegration.adoc#a3910,Default ViewHandler Implementation>>

Fix typo the specified createView() should be
called in renderView() and restoreView().

==== Chapter 10

Need to change "confirm with" to "conform
with".

Confusing verbiage in table 10-1 of JSF 2.0
spec regarding the word "template"

In table 10-1, it correctly says that "page
templating" is not a feature of JSP.

But later on in the table, it says
"Expressions in template text cause unexpected behavior when used in
JSP."

Somehow there needs to be an explanation of
the distinction of "page templating" and "template text" here. Right now
it kind of reads as a contradiction.

===== <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5632,General Requirements>>

Add an assertion to section 10.3.1 stating
that EL expressions that appear in the facelet XHTML page must appear in
the rendered view as if they were the right hand side of the value
attribute of an at the same point in the page as the EL expression

===== <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a5638,Facelet Tag Library mechanism>>

Section 10.3.2. Correct xref to point to
section in appendix that includes the facelet taglib schema.

Correct xref to point to section in appendix
that includes the facelet taglib schema.

===== VDLDocs

See <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a6043,Facelet Templating Tag Library>>,
and <<FaceletsAndWebApplications.adoc#a6047,Jakarta Tags Core and Function Tag Libraries>>.
Refer the reader to the "VDLDocs" (View Declaration Language Documentations).


==== Chapter 13

===== Redundancy in <<AjaxIntegration.adoc#a6831,Partial View Processing>> of the JSF 2.0 Spec

Section 13.4.2 of the JSF 2.0 spec has this
sentence:

The request contains special parameters that
indicate the request is a partial execute request or a partial execute
request that was triggered using Ajax

This needs clarification—does this mean to
say:

partial execute request (not triggered by
Ajax) or a partial execute request (that was triggered using Ajax)

===== "Execute portions" of the JSF request processing lifecycle in the JSF 2.0 Spec

Section 13.4.2 reads:

Although the diagram in Section 13.4 Partial
View Traversal˝ depicts the execute˝ portion as encompassing everything
except the Render Response Phase˝, it really is the Apply Request Values
Phase˝, Update Model Values Phase˝ and Process Validations Phase˝.

Why does the diagram include the
INVOKE_APPLICATION phase if it's not "really" considered to be part of
the execute portions?

==== Chapter 14

===== <<JavaScriptAPI.adoc#a6856,Initiating an Ajax Request>> Typo in table 14.2.2 of the JSF 2.0 Spec

Table 14.2.2 reads:

"execute" phase

But in order to be consistent with the rest
of the spec, it should read:

"execute" portion

Also, the same goes for "render" in that the
word "portion" should be used instead of "phase".

===== <<JavaScriptAPI.adoc#a6933,Request/Response Event Handling>> Table 14.4.1

Change responseTxt to responseText.

Table 14.3: Reorder rows

==== Appendix A Metadata

Update schema to remove partial-traversal, as
well as fixing 768.

==== VDLDoc changes

===== Typo in f:selectItems VDLDocs

Change "mest" to "must"

===== Need clarification on execute attribute of f:ajax

The VDLDocs for f:ajax say "Identifiers of
components" but, for some reason, it wasn't obvious to me that this term
referred to the "id" attributes of components. The recommendation isthat
this be clarified to say "list of <b>id</b> attribute values" instead.
Also, the value of an id attribute like "mycomponent" or something
should be added to an example that includes a keyword... something like
this: "@this componentone componenttwo"

===== Spelling error in VDLDocs for f:ajax

This one from Lincoln:

See the "onerror" attribute

There is an extra 'e' -> "oneerror"

===== Need clarification on required attribute in VDLDocs for tags that got a new "for" attribute in JSF 2.0

The VDLDocs correctly have green for the new
"for" attribute, but the "required" column says false, when that's not
always the case.

For example, with f:actionListener the
VDLDocs say that that it is not required. However, when the tag is used
as a child of a Composite Component, then the for attribute is indeed
required. This would be true of all tags like that, such as
f:convertDateTime, f:convertNumber, etc.

===== Uppercase typo in VDLDocs for f:event

Change uppercase "P" to lowercase for:
PostAddToView for the f:event VDLDocs

===== Need to change "JSP" to "Facelets" in "Body Content" of VDLDocs

Search for "JSP" on the f:event VDLDocs.
My suspicion is that this is a problem across the board.

===== Need clarification in VDLDocs for f:metadata

In the VDLDocs for f:metadata, recommend
changing:

"This tag must reside within the top level
XHTML file for the given viewId, not in a template"

to this:

"This tag must reside within the top level
Facelet view, or in a template-client, but not in a template"

Also, it needs to be clarified that the
page01.xhtml example is a template-client. So recommend changing this:

"viewId XHTML page, page01.xhtml"

to this:

"template-client XHTML page, page01.xhtml"

===== Missing description in VDLDocs for name attribute of f:viewParam

The VDLDocs for f:viewParam are missing
documentation of the "name" attribute, which is pretty important since
it is required.

===== VLDDocs on "for" attribute of f:viewParam claim it can be used in a CC

The VDLDocs for f:viewParam claim that the
"for" attribute is supported. I just checked Mojarra's jsf-api and
UIViewParameter.java does not support the "for" attribute, since it does
not have a getter/setter for "for" like HtmlOutputLabel does. There are
restrictions on f:viewParam such that it may only be used inside of
f:metadata, and f:metadata may only be used inside of f:view. So that
disqualifies the f:viewParam tag from being able to be used inside of a
Composite Component. Therefore I recommend that the documentation of the
"for" attribute be totally removed.

===== Miscellaneous VDLDoc items

* VDLDocs for "execute" attribute of f:ajax say
(must evaluate to java.lang.Object) but then say "Evaluates to
Collection"

* VDLDocs f:selectItem lists the new JSF 2.0
"noSelectionOption" but is not colored green to indicate "new in JSF
2.0" and the link for f:selectItem in the navigation frame needs to be
orange

* VDLDocs for f:validateBean should have all of
its attributes in green to indicate "new in JSF 2.0" since it is a new
tag.

* VDLDocs for f:validateRegex has a typo in the
description which reads "RegexpValidator" rather than "RegexValidator"

* In spec, the "Changes between 1.2 and EDR2"
section refers the reader to section 3.5.2 for the addition of
"javax.faces.RegularExpressionValidator" but actually it should be
section 3.5.5

* VDLDocs for h:button say that the outcome
attribute is not required, but really it should be required otherwise
there is no purpose of f:button—you would end up navigating back to
the current view. The whole point of f:button is to perform navigation
to a different view that potentially contains view parameters. Why have
a bookmarkable URL back to itself?

* VDLDocs for h:button don't mention a disabled
attribute, but the h:link one does have the disabled attribute. My guess
would be that both should have this attribute?

* VDLDocs for h:outputScript and
h:outputStylesheet should indicate that even though the UIOutput class
implements the ValueHolder interface, the coverter and value attributes
are basically ignored by the renderers, since the value attribute has no
meaning. This is basically a design flaw—a new class named
UIOutputResource should have been created instead of UIOutput being
reused.

* VDLDocs for h:outputScript and
h:outputStylesheet should indicate that the "name" attribute is
required, since section 2.6.1.3 implies that this is the case with the
following resource pattern:
[localePrefix/][libraryName/][libraryVersion/]resourceName[/resourceVersion]

* VDLDocs for h:outputScript needs to have all
the possible values for the target attribute documented. I think the
only valid values are "head", "body", and "form"

* VDLDocs for h:graphicImage has a dead
hyperlink to "Common Algorithm for Obtaining A Resource to Render

* VDLDocs for h:selectManyCheckbox indicate
orange for the collectionType and hideNoSelectionOption attributes but
they should be green to indicate "new in JSF 2.0"

* VDLDocs for h:selectManyCheckbox says that
the return type must evaluate to a String, but that's not entirely true.
It can also evaluate to a concrete class that implements
java.util.Collection

* VDLDocs for ui:param have two "name"
attributes specified. The second one should be the "value" attribute

===== Should TLDDocs now be VDLDocs?

The Spec introduces this term VDLDocs (which
as I said in the other email, was formerly PDLDocs), but it also refers
the reader to the TLDDocs. Should we just settle on VDLDocs as the
standard term throughout the Spec?

===== Typo in VDLDocs for f:event.

The VDLDocs for f:event specify a "name"
attribute, but the Description column of the page talks about a "type"
column (not "name"), which would be consistent with Section 3.4.3.4 of
the Spec which talks about a "type" column.

Jim Driscoll verified that there is a doc bug
in the VDLDocs for f:event and that the "name" attribute is actually
"type"

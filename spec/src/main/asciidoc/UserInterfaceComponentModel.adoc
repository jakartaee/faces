== User Interface Component Model

A JSF _user interface component_ is the basic
building block for creating a JSF user interface. A particular component
represents a configurable and reusable element in the user interface,
which may range in complexity from simple (such as a button or text
field) to compound (such as a tree control or table). Components can
optionally be associated with corresponding objects in the data model of
an application, via _value expressions_ .

JSF also supports user interface components
with several additional helper APIs:

 _Converters_ —Pluggable support class to
convert the markup value of a component to and from the corresponding
type in the model tier.

 _Events and Listeners_ —An event broadcast
and listener registration model based on the design patterns of the
JavaBeans Specification, version 1.0.1.

 _Validators_ —Pluggable support classes that
can examine the local value of a component (as received in an incoming
request) and ensure that it conforms to the business rules enforced by
each Validator. Error messages for validation failures can be generated
and sent back to the user during rendering.

The user interface for a particular page of a
JSF-based web application is created by assembling the user interface
components for a particular request or response into a _view_ . The view
is a tree of classes that implement _UIComponent_ . The components in
the tree have parent-child relationships with other components, starting
at the _root element_ of the tree, which must be an instance of
_UIViewRoot_ . Components in the tree can be anonymous or they can be
given a _component identifier_ by the framework user. Components in the
tree can be located based on _component identifiers_ , which must be
unique within the scope of the nearest ancestor to the component that is
a _naming container_ . For complex rendering scenarios, components can
also be attached to other components as _facets_ .

This chapter describes the basic architecture
and APIs for user interface components and the supporting APIs.

=== UIComponent and UIComponentBase

The base abstract class for all user
interface components is _javax.faces.component.UIComponent_ . This class
defines the state information and behavioral contracts for all
components through a Java programming language API, which means that
components are independent of a rendering technology such as JavaServer
Pages (JSP). A standard set of components (described in
link:JSF.html#a1823[See Standard User Interface Components]”)
that add specialized properties, attributes, and behavior, is also
provided as a set of concrete subclasses.

Component writers, tool providers,
application developers, and JSF implementors can also create additional
_UIComponent_ implementations for use within a particular application.
To assist such developers, a convenience subclass,
_javax.faces.component.UIComponentBase_ , is provided as part of JSF.
This class provides useful default implementations of nearly every
_UIComponent_ method, allowing the component writer to focus on the
unique characteristics of a particular _UIComponent_ implementation.

The following subsections define the key
functional capabilities of JSF user interface components.

=== [[a895]]Component Identifiers

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public String getId();



public void setId(String componentId);

|===

[N/T-start may-component-identifier] Every
component may be named by a _component identifier_ that must conform to
the following rules:

They must start with a letter (as defined by
the _Character.isLetter()_ method).

Subsequent characters must be letters (as
defined by the _Character.isLetter()_ method), digits as defined by the
_Character.isDigit()_ method, dashes (‘-’), or underscores (‘_’).

[P1-end] To minimize the size of responses
generated by JavaServer Faces, it is recommended that component
identifiers be as short as possible.

If a component has been given an identifier,
it must be unique in the namespace of the closest ancestor to that
component that is a _NamingContainer_ (if any).

=== Component Type

While not a property of _UIComponent_ , the
_component-type_ is an important piece of data related to each
_UIComponent_ subclass that allows the _Application_ instance to create
new instances of _UIComponent_ subclasses with that type. Please see
link:JSF.html#a3468[See Object Factories] for more on
_component-type_ .

Component types starting with “javax.faces.”
are reserved for use by the JSF specification.

=== Component Family

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getFamily();
|===

Each standard user interface component class
has a standard value for the component family, which is used to look up
renderers associated with this component. Subclasses of a generic
UIComponent class will generally inherit this property from its
superclass, so that renderers who only expect the superclass will still
be able to process specialized subclasses.

Component families starting with
“javax.faces.” are reserved for use by the JSF specification.

=== [[a911]]ValueExpression properties

Properties and attributes of standard
concrete component classes may be _value expression enabled_ . This
means that, rather than specifying a literal value as the parameter to a
property or attribute setter, the caller instead associates a
_ValueExpression_ (see link:JSF.html#a3029[See ValueBinding])
whose _getValue()_ method must be called (by the property getter) to
return the actual property value to be returned if no value has been set
via the corresponding property setter. If a property or attribute value
has been set, that value must be returned by the property getter
(shadowing any associated value binding expression for this property).

Value binding expressions are managed with
the following method calls:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public ValueExpression
getValueExpression(String name);



public void setValueExpression(String name,
ValueExpression expression);

|===

{empty}where _name_ is the name of the
attribute or property for which to establish the value expression.
[P1-start setValueExpression rules] The implementation of
setValueExpression must detemine if the expression is a literal by
calling ValueExpression.isLiteralText() on the expression argument. If
the expression argument is literal text, then ValueExpression.getValue()
must be called on the expression argument. The result must be used as
the value argument, along with the name argument to this component’s
getAttributes().put(name, value) method call. [P1-end] [P1-start which
properties are value expression enabled] For the standard component
classes defined by this specification, all attributes, and all
properties other than _id_ , _parent_ , _action_ , _listener_ ,
_actionListener_ , _valueChangeListener_ , and _validator_ are value
expression enabled. The _action_ , _listener_ , _actionListener_ ,
_valueChangeListener_ , and _validator_ attributes are method expression
enabled.[P1-end]

In previous versions of this specification,
this concept was called “value binding”. Methods and classes referring
to this concept are deprecated, but remain implemented to preserve
backwards compatibility.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public ValueBinding getValueBinding(String
name);



public void setValueBinding(String name,
ValueBinding binding);

|===

Please consult the javadoc for these methods
to learn how they are implemented in terms of the new “value expression”
concept.

=== [[a923]]Component Bindings

A _component binding_ is a special value
expression that can be used to facilitate “wiring up” a component
instance to a corresponding property of a JavaBean that is associated
with the page, and wants to manipulate component instances
programatically. It is established by calling _setValueExpression()_
(see link:JSF.html#a911[See ValueExpression properties]) with
the special property name _binding_ .

The specified _ValueExpression_ must point to
a read-write JavaBeans property of type _UIComponent_ (or appropriate
subclass). Such a component binding is used at two different times
during the processing of a Faces Request:

{empty}[P3-start how a component binding is
used from a JSP page] When a component instance is first created
(typically by virtue of being referenced by a _UIComponentELTag_ in a
JSP page), the JSF implementation will retrieve the _ValueExpression_
for the name _binding,_ and call _getValue()_ on it. If this call
returns a non-null _UIComponent_ value (because the JavaBean
programmatically instantiated and configured a component already), that
instance will be added to the component tree that is being created. If
the call returns _null_ , a new component instance will be created,
added to the component tree, and _setValue()_ will be called on the
_ValueExpression_ (which will cause the property on the JavaBean to be
set to the newly created component instance). [P3-end]

{empty}[P1-start how a component binding is
used when restoring the tree]When a component tree is recreated during
the _Restore View_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, for each
component that has a _ValueExpression_ associated with the name
“binding”, _setValue()_ will be called on it, passing the recreated
component instance. [P1-end]

Component bindings are often used in
conjunction with JavaBeans that are dynamically instantiated via the
Managed Bean Creation facility (see _link:JSF.html#a3020[See
VariableResolver and the Default VariableResolver]_ ). If application
developers place managed beans that are pointed at by component binding
expressions in any scope other than request scope, the system cannot
behave correctly. This is because placing it in a scope wider than
request scope would require thread safety, since UIComponent instances
depend on running inside of a single thread. There are also potentially
negative impacts on memory management when placing a component binding
in “session” or “view” scopes.

=== Client Identifiers

Client identifiers are used by JSF
implementations, as they decode and encode components, for any occasion
when the component must have a client side name. Some examples of such
an occasion are:

to name request parameters for a subsequent
request from the JSF-generated page.

to serve as anchors for client side scripting
code.

to serve as anchors for client side
accessibility labels.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public String getClientId(FacesContext
context);

protected String
getContainerClientId(FacesContext context);

|===

The client identifier is derived from the
component identifier (or the result of calling
_UIViewRoot.createUniqueId()_ if there is not one), and the client
identifier of the closest parent component that is a _NamingContainer_
according to the algorithm specified in the javadoc for
_UIComponent.getClientId()_ . The _Renderer_ associated with this
component, if any, will then be asked to convert this client identifier
to a form appropriate for sending to the client. The value returned from
this method must be the same throughout the lifetime of the component
instance unless _setId()_ is called, in which case it will be
recalculated by the next call to _getClientId()_ .

=== [[a937]]Component Tree Manipulation

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public UIComponent getParent();



public void setParent(UIComponent parent);

|===

Components that have been added as children
of another component can identify the parent by calling the _getParent_
method. For the root node component of a component tree, or any
component that is not part of a component tree, _getParent_ will return
_null_ . In some special cases, such as transient components, it is
possible that a component in the tree will return _null_ from
getParent(). The _setParent()_ method should only be called by the
_List_ instance returned by calling the _getChildren()_ method, or the
_Map_ instance returned by calling the _getFacets()_ method, when child
components or facets are being added, removed, or replaced.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public List<UIComponent> getChildren();
|===

Return a mutable _List_ that contains all of
the child _UIComponent_ s for this component instance. [P1-start
requirements of UIComponent.getChildren() ] The returned _List_
implementation must support all of the required and optional methods of
the _List_ interface, as well as update the parent property of children
that are added and removed, as described in the Javadocs for this
method. [P1-end] Note that the _add()_ methods have a special
requirement to cause the _PostAddToViewEvent_ method to be fired, as
well as the processing of the _ResourceDependency_ annotation. See the
javadocs for _getChildren()_ for details.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public int getChildCount();
|===

{empty}A convenience method to return the
number of child components for this component. [P2-start
UIComponent.getChildCount requirements.] If there are no children, this
method must return 0. The method must not cause the creation of a child
component list, so it is preferred over calling _getChildren().size()_
when there are no children. [P2-end]

=== [[a946]]Component Tree Navigation

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public UIComponent findComponent(String
expr);
|===

Search for and return the UIComponent with an
_id_ that matches the specified search expression (if any), according to
the algorithm described in the Javadocs for this method.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Iterator<UIComponent>
getFacetsAndChildren();
|===

Return an immutable _Iterator_ over all of
the facets associated with this component (in an undetermined order),
followed by all the child components associated with this component (in
the order they would be returned by _getChildren()_ )..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public boolean
invokeOnComponent(FacesContext context, String clientId, ContextCallback
callback) throws FacesException;
|===

Starting at _this_ component in the view,
search for the UIComponent whose _getClientId()_ method returns a String
that exactly matches the argument _clientId_ using the algorithm
specified in the Javadocs for this method. If such a UIComponent is
found, call the _invokeContextCallback()_ method on the argument
_callback_ passing the current _FacesContext_ and the found UIComponent.
Upon normal return from the callback, return _true_ to the caller. If
the callback throws an exception, it must be wrapped inside of a
_FacesException_ and re-thrown. If no such UIComponent is found, return
_false_ to the caller.

Special consideration should be given to the
implementation of _invokeOnComponent()_ for UIComponent classes that
handle iteration, such as _UIData_ . Iterating components manipulate
their own internal state to handle iteration, and doing so alters the
clientIds of components nested within the iterating component.
Implementations of _invokeOnComponent()_ must guarantee that any state
present in the component or children is restored before returning.
Please see the Javadocs for _UIData.invokeOnComponent()_ for details.

The _ContextCallback_ interface is specified
as follows..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public interface ContextCallback \{

 public void
invokeContextCallback(FacesContext context, UIComponent target);



}

|===

Please consult the Javadocs for more details
on this interface.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public static UIComponent
getCurrentComponent(FacesContext context);
|===

Returns the UIComponent instance that is
currently being processed.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public static UIComponent
getCurrentCompositeComponent(FacesContext context);
|===

Returns the closest ancestor component
relative to getCurrentComponent that is a composite component, or null
if no such component is exists.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public boolean visitTree(VisitContext
context,

 VisitCallback callback);



|===

Uses the visit API introduced in version 2 of
the specification to perform a flexible and customizable visit of the
tree from this instance and its children. Please see the package
description for the package _javax.faces.component.visit_ for the
normative specification.

=== [[a968]]Facet Management

JavaServer Faces supports the traditional
model of composing complex components out of simple components via
parent-child relationships that organize the entire set of components
into a tree, as described in link:JSF.html#a937[See Component
Tree Manipulation]. However, an additional useful facility is the
ability to define particular subordinate components that have a specific
_role_ with respect to the owning component, which is typically
independent of the parent-child relationship. An example might be a
“data grid” control, where the children represent the columns to be
rendered in the grid. It is useful to be able to identify a component
that represents the column header and/or footer, separate from the usual
child collection that represents the column data.

To meet this requirement, JavaServer Faces
components offer support for _facets_ , which represent a named
collection of subordinate (but non-child) components that are related to
the current component by virtue of a unique _facet name_ that represents
the role that particular component plays. Although facets are not part
of the parent-child tree, they participate in request processing
lifecycle methods, as described in link:JSF.html#a1059[See
Lifecycle Management Methods].

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Map<String, UIComponent> getFacets();
|===

Return a mutable Map representing the facets
of this UIComponent, keyed by the facet name.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public UIComponent getFacet(String name);
|===

A convenience method to return a facet value,
if it exists, or _null_ otherwise. If the requested facet does not
exist, no facets _Map_ must not be created, so it is preferred over
calling _getFacets().get()_ when there are no _Facet_ s.

For easy use of components that use facets,
component authors may include type-safe getter and setter methods that
correspond to each named facet that is supported by that component
class. For example, a component that supports a _header_ facet of type
_UIHeader_ should have methods with signatures and functionality as
follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public UIHeader getHeader() \{

 return ((UIHeader) getFacet(“header”);

}



public void setHeader(UIHeader header) \{

 getFacets().put(“header”, header);

}

|===

=== [[a983]]Managing Component Behavior

 _UIComponentBase_ provides default
implementations for the methods from the _javax.faces.c_ o
_mponent.behavior.BehaviorHolder_ interface. _UIComponentBase_ does not
implement the _javax.faces.component.behavior.BehaviorHolder_ interface,
but it provides the default implementations to simplify subclass
implemenations. Refer to
link:JSF.html#a1707[See Component
Behavior Model] for more information.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void addBehavior(String eventName,
Behavior behavior)
|===

This method attaches a _Behavior_ to the
component for the specified _eventName. The eventName_ must be one of
the values in the _Collection_ returned from _getEventNames(). F_ or
example, it may be desired to have some behavior defined when a “click”
event occurs. The behavior could be some client side behavior in the
form of a script executing, or a server side listener executing.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Collection<String> getEventNames()
|===

Returns the logical event names that can be
associated with behavior for the component.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Map<String, List<Behavior>>
getBehaviors()
|===

Returns a _Map_ defining the association of
events and behaviors. They keys in the _Map_ are event names.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getDefaultEventName()
|===

Returns the default event name (if any) for
the component.

=== [[a993]]Generic Attributes

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Map<String, Object> getAttributes();
|===

The render-independent characteristics of
components are generally represented as JavaBean component properties
with getter and setter methods (see link:JSF.html#a1021[See
Render-Independent Properties]). In addition, components may also be
associated with generic attributes that are defined outside the
component implementation class. Typical uses of generic attributes
include:

Specification of render-dependent
characteristics, for use by specific _Renderer_ s.

General purpose association of
application-specific objects with components.

The attributes for a component may be of any
Java programming language object type, and are keyed by attribute name
(a String). However, see link:JSF.html#a4135[See State Saving
Alternatives and Implications] for implications of your application’s
choice of state saving method on the classes used to implement attribute
values.

Attribute names that begin with _javax.faces_
are reserved for use by the JSF specification. Names that begin with
_javax_ are reserved for definition through the Java Community Process.
Implementations are not allowed to define names that begin with _javax._

[P1-start attribute property transparency
rules] The _Map_ returned by _getAttributes()_ must also support
attribute-property transparency, which operates as follows:

When the _get()_ method is called, if the
specified attribute name matches the name of a readable JavaBeans
property on the component implementation class, the value returned will
be acquired by calling the appropriate property getter method, and
wrapping Java primitive values (such as int) in their corresponding
wrapper classes (such as _java.lang.Integer_ ) if necessary. If the
specified attribute name does not match the name of a readable JavaBeans
property on the component implementation class, consult the internal
data-structure to in which generic attributes are stored. If no entry
exists in the internal data-structure, see if there is a
_ValueExpression_ for this attribute name by calling
_getValueExpression()_ , passing the attribute name as the key. If a
_ValueExpression_ exists, call _getValue()_ on it, returning the result.
If an _ELException_ is thrown wrap it in a _FacesException_ and re-throw
it.

When the _put()_ method is called, if the
specified attribute name matches the name of a writable JavaBeans
property on the component implementation class, the appropriate property
setter method will be called. If the specified attribute name does not
match the name of a writable JavaBeans property, simply put the value in
the data-structure for generic attributes.

When the _remove()_ method is called, if the
specified attribute name matches the name of a JavaBeans property on the
component, an _IllegalArgumentException_ must be thrown.

When the _containsKey()_ method is called, if
the specified attribute name matches the name of a JavaBeans property,
return _false_ . Otherwise, return _true_ if and only if the specified
attribute name exists in the internal data-structure for the generic
attributes.

{empty}The _Map_ returned by
_getAttributes()_ must also conform to the entire contract for the _Map_
interface. [P1-end]

=== [[a1006]]Special Attributes

=== UIComponent Constants

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public static final String CURRENT_COMPONENT

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public static final String
COMPOSITE_FACET_NAME = "javax.faces.component.COMPOSITE_FACET_NAME";
|===

This is a key in the Map<PropertyDescriptor>
that is returned by using the key FACETS_KEY. The value of this constant
is also used as the key in the Map returned from getFacets(). In this
case, the value of this key is the facet (the UIPanel) that is the
parent of all the components in the composite implementation section of
the composite component VDL file.

Refer to the
javax.faces.component.UIComponent Javadocs for more detailed
information.

=== [[a1021]]Render-Independent Properties

The render-independent characteristics of a
user interface component are represented as JavaBean component
properties, following JavaBeans naming conventions. Specifically, the
method names of the getter and/or setter methods are determined using
standard JavaBeans component introspection rules, as defined by
_java.beans.Introspector_ . The render-independent properties supported
by all _UIComponent_ s are described in the following table:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _id_ |RW
|String |The
component identifier, as described in link:JSF.html#a895[See
Component Identifiers].

| _parent_ |RW
| _UIComponent_
|The parent component for which this
component is a child or a facet.

| _rendered_ |RW
| _boolean_ |A
flag that, if set to _true_ , indicates that this component should be
processed during all phases of the request processing lifecycle. The
default value is “true”.

| _rendererType_
|RW | _String_
|Identifier of the _Renderer_ instance (from
the set of _Renderer_ instances supported by the _RenderKit_ associated
with the component tree we are processing. If this property is set,
several operations during the request processing lifecycle (such as
_decode_ and the _encodeXxx_ family of methods) will be delegated to a
_Renderer_ instance of this type. If this property is not set, the
component must implement these methods directly.

| _rendersChildren_
|RO | _boolean_
|A flag that, if set to _true_ , indicates
that this component manages the rendering of all of its children
components (so the JSF implementation should not attempt to render
them). The default implementation in _UIComponentBase_ delegates this
setting to the associated _Renderer_ , if any, and returns _false_
otherwise.

| _transient_ |RW
|boolean |A flag
that, if set to _true_ , indicates that this component must not be
included in the state of the component tree. The default implementation
in _UIComponentBase_ returns _false_ for this property.
|===

The method names for the render-independent
property getters and setters must conform to the design patterns in the
JavaBeans specification. See link:JSF.html#a4135[See State
Saving Alternatives and Implications] for implications of your
application’s choice of state saving method on the classes used to
implement property values.

=== [[a1041]]Component Specialization Methods

The methods described in this section are
called by the JSF implementation during the various phases of the
request processing lifecycle, and may be overridden in a concrete
subclass to implement specialized behavior for this component.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public boolean broadcast(FacesEvent event)
throws AbortProcessingException;
|===

The _broadcast()_ method is called during the
common event processing (see link:JSF.html#a494[See Common
Event Processing]) at the end of several request processing lifecycle
phases. For more information about the event and listener model, see
link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener Model]. Note that it
is not necessary to override this method to support additional event
types.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void decode(FacesContext context);
|===

This method is called during the _Apply
Request Values_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, and has the
responsibility of extracting a new local value for this component from
an incoming request. The default implementation in _UIComponentBase_
delegates to a corresponding _Renderer_ , if the _rendererType_ property
is set, and does nothing otherwise.

Generally, component writers will choose to
delegate decoding and encoding to a corresponding _Renderer_ by setting
the _rendererType_ property (which means the default behavior described
above is adequate).

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void encodeAll(FacesContext context)
throws IOException

public void encodeBegin(FacesContext context)
throws IOException;



public void encodeChildren(FacesContext
context) throws IOException;



public void encodeEnd(FacesContext context)
throws IOException;

|===

{empty}These methods are called during the
_Render Response_ phase of the request processing lifecycle.
_encodeAll()_ will cause this component and all its children and facets
that return _true_ from _isRendered()_ to be rendered, regardless of the
value of the _getRendersChildren()_ return value. _encodeBegin()_ ,
_encodeChildren()_ , and _encodeEnd()_ have the responsibility of
creating the response data for the beginning of this component, this
component’s children (only called if the _rendersChildren_ property of
this component is _true_ ), and the ending of this component,
respectively. Typically, this will involve generating markup for the
output technology being supported, such as creating an HTML _<input>_
element for a _UIInput_ component. For clients that support it, the
encode methods might also generate client-side scripting code (such as
JavaScript), and/or stylesheets (such as CSS). The default
implementations in _UIComponentBase_ _encodeBegin()_ and _encodeEnd()_
delegate to a corresponding _Renderer_ , if the _rendererType_ property
is _true_ , and do nothing otherwise. [P1-start-comp-special]The default
implementation in UIComponentBase _encodeChildren()_ must iterate over
its children and call _encodeAll()_ for each child component.
_encodeBegin()_ must publish a _PreRenderComponentEvent._ [P1-end]

Generally, component writers will choose to
delegate encoding to a corresponding _Renderer_ , by setting the
_rendererType_ property (which means the default behavior described
above is adequate).

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void queueEvent(FacesEvent event);
|===

Enqueue the specified event for broadcast at
the end of the current request processing lifecycle phase. Default
behavior is to delegate this to the _queueEvent()_ of the parent
component, normally resulting in broadcast via the default behavior in
the _UIViewRoot_ lifecycle methods.

The component author can override any of the
above methods to customize the behavior of their component.

=== [[a1059]]Lifecycle Management Methods

The following methods are called by the
various phases of the request processing lifecycle, and implement a
recursive tree walk of the components in a component tree, calling the
component specialization methods described above for each component.
These methods are not generally overridden by component writers, but
doing so may be useful for some advanced component implementations. See
the javadocs for detailed information on these methods

In order to support the “component” implicit
object (See link:JSF.html#a2830[See Implicit Object ELResolver
for Facelets and Programmatic Access]), the following methods have been
added to _UIComponent_

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
protected void pushComponentToEL(FacesContext
context);

[[a1088]]Component Behavioral Interfaces

In addition to extending _UIComponent_ ,
component classes may also implement one or more of the _behavioral
interfaces_ described below. Components that implement these interfaces
must provide the corresponding method signatures and implement the
described functionality.

=== [[a1090]]ActionSource

The _ActionSource_ interface defines a way
for a component to indicate that wishes to be a source of _ActionEvent_
events, including the ability invoke application actions (see
link:JSF.html#a3553[See Application Actions]) via the default
_ActionListener_ facility (see link:JSF.html#a3402[See
ActionListener Property]).

=== [[a1092]]Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _ActionSource_ interface:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _action_ |RW
| _MethodBinding_
|DEPRECATED A _MethodBinding_ (see
link:JSF.html#a3039[See MethodBinding]) that must (if non-
_null_ ) point at an action method (see link:JSF.html#a3553[See
Application Actions]). The specified method will be called during the
_Apply Request Values_ or _Invoke Application_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle, as described in link:JSF.html#a454[See
Invoke Application]. This method is replaced by the _actionExpression_
property on _ActionSource2._ See the javadocs for the backwards
compatibility implementation strategy.

|actionListener
|RW |MethodBinding
|DEPRECATED A _MethodBinding_ (see
link:JSF.html#a3039[See MethodBinding]) that (if non- _null_ )
must point at a method accepting an _ActionEvent_ , with a return type
of _void_ . Any _ActionEvent_ that is sent by this _ActionSource_ will
be passed to this method along with the _processAction()_ method of any
registered _ActionListener_ s, in either Apply Request Values or Invoke
Application phase, depending upon the state of the _immediate_ property.
See the javadocs for the backwards compatibility implementation
strategy.

|immediate |RW
|boolean |A flag
indicating that the default _ActionListener_ should execute immediately
(that is, during the _Apply Request Values_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle, instead of waiting for _Invoke Application_
phase). The default value of this property must be _false_ .
|===



=== Methods

 _ActionSource_ adds no new processing
methods.

=== Events

A component implementing _ActionSource_ is a
source of _ActionEvent_ events. There are three important moments in the
lifetime of an _ActionEvent_ :

when an the event is _created_

when the event is _queued_ for later
processing

when the listeners for the event are
_notified_

 _ActionEvent_ creation occurs when the
system detects that the component implementing _ActionSource_ has been
activated. For example, a button has been pressed. This happens when the
_decode()_ processing of the _Apply Request Values_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle detects that the corresponding user interface
control was activated.

 _ActionEvent_ queueing occurs immediately
after the event is created.

Event listeners that have registered an
interest in _ActionEvent_ s fired by this component (see below) are
notified at the end of the _Apply Request Values_ or _Invoke
Application_ phase, depending upon the immediate property of the
originating _UICommand_ .

 _ActionSource_ includes the following
methods to register and deregister _ActionListener_ instances interested
in these events. See link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener
Model] for more details on the event and listener model provided by JSF.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void addActionListener(ActionListener
listener);



public void
removeActionListener(ActionListener listener);

|===

In addition to manually registered listeners,
the JSF implementation provides a default _ActionListener_ that will
process _ActionEvent_ events during the _Apply Request Values_ or
_Invoke Application_ phases of the request processing lifecycle. See
link:JSF.html#a454[See Invoke Application] for more
information.

=== [[a1120]]ActionSource2

The _ActionSource2_ interface extends
_ActionSource_ and provides a JavaBeans property analogous to the
_action_ property on _ActionSource_ . This allows the _ActionSource_
concept to leverage the new Unified EL API.

=== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _ActionSource_ interface:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _actionExpression_
|RW |
_javax.el.MethodExpression_ |A
_MethodExpression_ (see link:JSF.html#a3039[See MethodBinding])
that must (if non- _null_ ) point at an action method (see
link:JSF.html#a3553[See Application Actions]). The specified
method will be called during the _Apply Request Values_ or _Invoke
Application_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, as described in
link:JSF.html#a454[See Invoke Application].
|===



=== Methods

 _ActionSource2_ adds no new processing
methods.

=== Events

 _ActionSource2_ adds no new events.

=== [[a1134]]NamingContainer

 _NamingContainer_ is a marker interface.
Components that implement _NamingContainer_ have the property that, for
all of their children that have non- _null_ component identifiers, all
of those identifiers are unique. This property is enforced by the
_renderView()_ method on _ViewHandler_ . In JSP based applications, it
is also enforced by the _UIComponentELTag_ . Since this is just a marker
interface, there are no properties, methods, or events. Among the
standard components, _UIForm_ and _UIData_ implement _NamingContainer_ .
See link:JSF.html#a1932[See UIForm] and _Section_
link:JSF.html#a1921[See Methods] “UIData” for details of how the
_NamingContainer_ concept is used in these two cases.

 _NamingContainer_ defines a public static
final character constant, _SEPARATOR_CHAR_ , that is used to separate
components of client identifiers, as well as the components of search
expressions used by the _findComponent()_ method see
(link:JSF.html#a946[See Component Tree Navigation]). The value
of this constant must be a colon character (“:”).

Use of this separator character in client
identifiers rendered by _Renderer_ s can cause problems with CSS
stylesheets that attach styles to a particular client identifier. For
the Standard HTML RenderKit, this issue can be worked around by using
the _style_ attribute to specify CSS style values directly, or the
_styleClass_ attribute to select CSS styles by class rather than by
identifier.

=== [[a1138]]StateHolder

The _StateHolder_ interface is implemented by
_UIComponent_ , _Converter_ , _FacesListener_ , and _Validator_ classes
that need to save their state between requests. _UIComponent_ implements
this interface to denote that components have state that must be saved
and restored between requests.

=== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _StateHolder_ interface:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
| _transient_ |RW
| _boolean_ |A
flag indicating whether this instance has decided to opt out of having
its state information saved and restored. The default value for all
standard component, converter, and validator classes that implement
_StateHolder_ must be _false_ .
|===



=== Methods

Any class implementing _StateHolder_ must
implement both the _saveState()_ and _restoreState()_ methods, since
these two methods have a tightly coupled contract between themselves. In
other words, if there is an inheritance hierarchy, it is not permissible
to have the _saveState()_ and _restoreState()_ methods reside at
different levels of the hierarchy.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public Object saveState(FacesContext
context);

public void restoreState(FacesContext
context, Object state) throws IOException;

|===

Gets or restores the state of the instance as
a _Serializable_ _Object_ .

If the class that implements this interface
has references to Objects which also implement _StateHolder_ (such as a
_UIComponent_ with a converter, event listeners, and/or validators)
these methods must call the _saveState()_ or _restoreState()_ method on
all those instances as well.

Any class implementing _StateHolder_ must
have a public no-args constructor.

If the state saving method is server, these
methods may not be called.

If the class that implements this interface
has references to Objects which do not implement _StateHolder_ , these
methods must ensure that the references are preserved. For example,
consider class _MySpecialComponent_ , which implements _StateHolder_ ,
and keeps a reference to a helper class, _MySpecialComponentHelper_ ,
which does not implement _StateHolder_ .
_MySpecialComponent.saveState()_ must save enough information about
_MySpecialComponentHelper_ , so that when
_MySpecialComponent.restoreState()_ is called, the reference to
_MySpecialComponentHelper_ can be restored. The return from
_saveState()_ must be _Serializable_ .

Since all of the standard user interface
components listed in link:JSF.html#a1823[See Standard User
Interface Components]” extend from _UIComponent_ , they all implement
the _StateHolder_ interface. In addition, the standard _Converter_ and
_Validator_ classes that require state to be saved and restored also
implement _StateHolder._

=== Events

 _StateHolder_ does not originate any
standard events.

=== [[a1159]]PartialStateHolder

 _PartialStateHolder_ extends _StateHolder_
and adds a usage contract for components that wish to take part in the
partial state saving mechanism introduced in version 2.0.
Implementations of this interface should use the
_javax.faces.component.StateHelper_ instance returned from
_UIComponent.getStateHelper()_ to store stateful component information
that otherwise would have been stored as instance variables on the class
implementing _PartialStateHolder_ .

=== Properties

 _PartialStateHolder_ adds no properties to
the _StateHolder_ contract

=== [[a1215]]Methods

The following methods support the partial
state saving feature:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
void clearInitialState();



boolean initialStateMarked();



void markInitialState();

|===

These methods allow the state saving feature
to determine if the component is in its initial state or not, and to set
the flag indicating this condition of existence. The Javadocs for these
methods specify the conditions under which these methods are invoked.

=== Events

 _PartialStateHolder_ does not originate any
standard events.

=== [[a1173]]ValueHolder

 _ValueHolder_ is an interface that may be
implemented by any concrete _UIComponent_ that wishes to support a local
value, as well as access data in the model tier via a _value expression_
, and support conversion between _String_ and the model tier data's
native data type.

=== [[a1175]]Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _ValueHolder_ interface:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|converter |RW
|Converter |The
_Converter_ (if any) that is registered for this UIComponent.

| _value_ |RW
| _Object_ |First
consult the local value property of this component. If non- _null_
return it. If the local value property is _null_ , see if we have a
_ValueExpression_ for the value property. If so, return the result of
evaluating the property, otherwise return _null_ .

|localValue |RO
|Object |allows
any value set by calling _setValue()_ to be returned, without
potentially evaluating a _ValueExpression_ the way that _getValue()_
will do
|===

Like nearly all component properties, the
_value_ property may have a value binding expression (see
link:JSF.html#a911[See ValueExpression properties]) associated
with it. If present (and if there is no _value_ set directly on this
component), such an expression is utilized to retrieve a value
dynamically from a model tier object during _Render Response Phase_ of
the request processing lifecycle. In addition, for input components, the
value expression is used during _Update Model Values_ phase (on the
subsequent request) to push the possibly updated component value back to
the model tier object.

The _Converter_ property is used to allow the
component to know how to convert the model type from the _String_ format
provided by the Servlet API to the proper type in the model tier.

The _Converter_ property must be inspected
for the presence of _ResourceDependency_ and _ResourceDependencies_
annotations as described in the Javadocs for the _setConverter_ method.

=== Methods

ValueHolder adds no methods.

=== Events

 _ValueHolder_ does not originate any
standard events.

=== [[a1192]]EditableValueHolder

The _EditableValueHolder_ interface (extends
_ValueHolder_ , see link:JSF.html#a1173[See ValueHolder])
describes additional features supported by editable components,
including _ValueChangeEvents_ and _Validators_ .

=== Properties

The following render-independent properties
are added by the _EditableValueHolder_ interface:

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Name |Access
|Type |Description
|immediate |RW
|boolean |Flag
indicating that conversion and validation of this component’s value
should occur during _Apply Request Values_ phase instead of _Process
Validations_ phase.

|localValueSet |RW
|boolean |Flag
indicating whether the _value_ property has been set.

|required |RW
|boolean |Is the
user required to provide a non-empty value for this component? Default
value must be _false_ .

|submittedValue
|RW | _Object_
|The submitted, unconverted, value of this
component. This property should only be set by the decode() method of
this component, or its corresponding Renderer, or by the validate method
of this component. This property should only be read by the validate()
method of this component.

|valid |RW
|boolean |A flag
indicating whether the local value of this component is valid (that is,
no conversion error or validation error has occurred).

|validator |RW
|MethodBinding
|DEPRECATED A _MethodBinding_ that (if not
null) must point at a method accepting a _FacesContext_ and a _UIInput_
, with a return type of _void_ . This method will be called during
_Process Validations_ phase, after any validators that are externally
registered. See the javadocs for the backwards compatibility strategy.

|valueChangeListener
|RW |MethodBinding
|DEPRECATED A MethodBinding that (if not
null) must point at a method that accepts a _ValueChangeEvent_ , with a
return type of _void_ . The specified method will be called during the
_Process Validations_ phase of the request processing lifecycle, after
any externally registered _ValueChangeListener_ s. See the javadocs for
the backwards compatibility strategy.
|===

=== Methods

The following methods support the validation
functionality performed during the _Process Validations_ phase of the
request processing lifecycle:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void addValidator(Validator
validator);



public void removeValidator(Validator
validator);

|===

The _addValidator()_ and _removeValidator()_
methods are used to register and deregister additional external
_Validator_ instances that will be used to perform correctness checks on
the local value of this component.

If the _validator_ property is not null, the
method it points at must be called by the _processValidations()_ method,
after the _validate()_ method of all registered _Validator_ s is called.

The addValidator’s Validator argument must be
inspected for the presense of the ResourceDependency and
ResourceDependencies annotations as described in the Javadocs for the
addValidator method.

=== [[a1223]]Events

 _EditableValueHolder_ is a source of
_ValueChangeEvent_ , _PreValidateEvent_ and _PostValidate_ events. These
are emitted during calls to _validate()_ , which happens during the
_Process Validations_ phase of the request processing lifecycle. The
_PreValidateEvent_ is published immediately before the component gets
validated. _PostValidate_ is published after validation has occurred,
regardless if the validation was successful or not. If the validation
for the component did pass successfully, and the previous value of this
component differs from the current value, the _ValueChangeEvent_ is
published. The following methods allow listeners to register and
deregister for _ValueChangeEvent_ s. __ See
link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener Model] for more
details on the event and listener model provided by JSF.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void
addValueChangeListener(ValueChangeListener listener);



public void
removeValueChangeListener(ValueChangeListener listener);

|===

In addition to the above listener
registration methods, If the _valueChangeListener_ property is not
_null_ , the method it points at must be called by the _broadcast()_
method, after the _processValueChange()_ method of all registered
_ValueChangeListener_ s is called.

=== [[a1229]]SystemEventListenerHolder

Classes that implement this interface agree
to maintain a list of _SystemEventListener_ instances for each kind of
_SystemEvent_ they can generate. This interface enables arbitrary
Objects to act as the source for _SystemEvent_ instances.

=== Properties

This interface contains no JavaBeans
properties

=== Methods

The following method gives the JSF runtime
access to the list of listeners stored by this instance.:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public List<FacesLifecycleListener>
getListenersForEventClass(Class<? extends SystemEvent> facesEventClass);
|===

During the processing for
_Application.publishEvent()_ , if the _source_ argument to that method
implements _SystemEventListenerHolder_ , the
_getListenersForEventClass()_ method is invoked on it, and each listener
in the list is given an opportunity to process the event, as specified
in the javadocs for _Application.publishEvent()_ .

=== Events

While the class that implements
_SystemEventListenerHolder_ is indeed a source of events, it is a call
to _Application.publishEvent()_ that causes the event to actually be
emitted. In the interest of maximum flexibility, this interface does not
define how listeners are added, removed, or stored. See
link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener Model] for more
details on the event and listener model provided by JSF.

=== [[a1239]]ClientBehaviorHolder

[P1-start-addBehavior] Components must
implement the _ClientBehaviorHolder_ interface to add the ability for
attaching ClientBehavior instances (see
link:JSF.html#a1707[See Component
Behavior Model]). Components that extend UIComponentBase only need to
implement the getEventNames() method and specify "implements
ClientBehaviorHolder". UIComponentBase provides base implementations for
all other methods. [P1-end] The concrete HTML component classes that
come with JSF implement the _ClientBehaviorHolder_ interface.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void addClientBehavior(String
eventName, ClientBehavior behavior);
|===

Attach a ClientBehavior to a component
implementing this _ClientBehaviorHolder_ interface for the specified
event. A default implementation of this method is provided in
UIComponentBase to make it easier for subclass implementations to add
behaviors.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Collection<String> getEventNames();
|===

{empty}Return a Collection of logical event
names that are supported by the component implementing this
_ClientBehaviorHolder_ interface. [P1-start-getEventNames]The Collection
must be non null and unmodifiable.[P1-end]

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Map<String, List<ClientBehavior>>
getClientBehaviors();
|===

Return a Map containing the event-client
behavior association. Each event in the Map may contain one or more
ClientBehavior instances that were added via the addClientBehavior()
method.

{empty}[P1-start-getBehaviors]Each key value
in this Map must be one of the event names in the Collection returned
from getEventNames().[P1-end]

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getDefaultEventName();
|===

Return the default event name for this
component behavior if the component defines a default event.

===

[[a1251]]Conversion Model

This section describes the facilities
provided by JavaServer Faces to support type conversion between
server-side Java objects and their (typically String-based)
representation in presentation markup.

=== Overview

A typical web application must constantly
deal with two fundamentally different viewpoints of the underlying data
being manipulated through the user interface:

The _model_ view—Data is typically
represented as Java programming language objects (often JavaBeans
components), with data represented in some native Java programming
language datatype. For example, date and time values might be
represented in the model view as instances of _java.util.Date_ .

The _presentation_ view—Data is typically
represented in some form that can be perceived or modified by the user
of the application. For example, a date or type value might be
represented as a text string, as three text strings (one each for
month/date/year or one each for hour/minute/second), as a calendar
control, associated with a spin control that lets you increment or
decrement individual elements of the date or time with a single mouse
click, or in a variety of other ways. Some presentation views may depend
on the preferred language or locale of the user (such as the commonly
used mm/dd/yy and dd/mm/yy date formats, or the variety of punctuation
characters in monetary amount presentations for various currencies).

To transform data formats between these
views, JavaServer Faces provides an ability to plug-in an optional
_Converter_ for each _ValueHolder_ , which has the responsibility of
converting the internal data representation between the two views. The
application developer attaches a particular _Converter_ to a particular
_ValueHolder_ by calling _setConverter_ , passing an instance of the
particular converter. A _Converter_ implementation may be acquired from
the _Application_ instance (see link:JSF.html#a3468[See Object
Factories]) for your application.

=== [[a1258]]Converter

JSF provides the
_javax.faces.convert.Converter_ interface to define the behavioral
characteristics of a _Converter_ . Instances of implementations of this
interface are either identified by a _converter identifier_ , or by a
class for which the _Converter_ class asserts that it can perform
successful conversions, which can be registered with, and later
retrieved from, an _Application_ , as described in
link:JSF.html#a3468[See Object Factories].

Often, a _Converter_ will be an object that
requires no extra configuration information to perform its
responsibilities. However, in some cases, it is useful to provide
configuration parameters to the _Converter_ (such as a
_java.text.DateFormat_ pattern for a _Converter_ that supports
_java.util.Date_ model objects). Such configuration information will
generally be provided via JavaBeans properties on the _Converter_
instance.

 _Converter_ implementations should be
programmed so that the conversions they perform are symmetric. In other
words, if a model data object is converted to a String (via a call to
the _getAsString_ method), it should be possible to call _getAsObject_
and pass it the converted String as the value parameter, and return a
model data object that is semantically equal to the original one. In
some cases, this is not possible. For example, a converter that uses the
formatting facilities provided by the _java.text.Format_ class might
create two adjacent integer numbers with no separator in between, and in
this case the _Converter_ could not tell which digits belong to which
number.

For _UIInput_ and _UIOutput_ components that
wish to explicitly select a _Converter_ to be used, a new _Converter_
instance of the appropriate type must be created, optionally configured,
and registered on the component by calling _setConverter()_
link:#a9086[4]. Otherwise, the JSF implementation will
automatically create new instances based on the data type being
converted, if such Converter classes have been registered. In either
case, Converter implementations need not be threadsafe, because they
will be used only in the context of a single request processing thread.

The following two method signatures are
defined by the _Converter_ interface:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Object getAsObject(FacesContext
context, UIComponent component, String value) throws ConverterException;
|===

This method is used to convert the
presentation view of a component’s value (typically a String that was
received as a request parameter) into the corresponding model view. It
is called during the _Apply Request Values_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getAsString(FacesContext
context, UIComponent component, Object value) throws ConverterException;
|===

This method is used to convert the model view
of a component’s value (typically some native Java programming language
class) into the presentation view (typically a String that will be
rendered in some markup language. It is called during the _Render
Response_ phase of the request processing lifecycle.

{empty}[P1-start-converter-resource]If the
class implementing Converter has a ResourceDependency annotation or a
ResourceDependencies annotation, the action described in the Javadocs
for the Converter interface must be followed when
ValueHolder.setConverter is called.[P1-end]

=== Standard Converter Implementations

JSF provides a set of standard _Converter_
implementations. A JSF implementation must register the _DateTime_ and
_Number_ converters by name with the _Application_ instance for this web
application, as described in the table below. This ensures that the
converters are available for subsequent calls to
_Application.createConverter()_ . Each concrete implementation class
must define a static final String constant _CONVERTER_ID_ whose value is
the standard converter id under which this Converter is registered.

[P1-start standard converters] The following
converter id values must be registered to create instances of the
specified Converter implementation classes:

 _javax.faces.BigDecimal_ -- An instance of
_javax.faces.convert.BigDecimalConverter_ (or a subclass of this class).

 _javax.faces.BigInteger_ -- An instance of
_javax.faces.convert.BigIntegerConverter_ (or a subclass of this class).

 _javax.faces.Boolean_ -- An instance of
_javax.faces.convert.BooleanConverter_ (or a subclass of this class).

 _javax.faces.Byte_ -- An instance of
_javax.faces.convert.ByteConverter_ (or a subclass of this class).

 _javax.faces.Character_ -- An instance of
_javax.faces.convert.CharacterConverter_ (or a subclass of this class).

[[a1300]]Event and Listener Model

This section describes how JavaServer Faces
provides support for generating and handling user interface events and
system events.

=== [[a1302]]Overview

JSF implements a model for event notification
and listener registration based on the design patterns in the _JavaBeans
Specification_ , version 1.0.1. This is similar to the approach taken in
other user interface toolkits, such as the Swing Framework included in
the JDK.

A _UIComponent_ subclass may choose to emit
_events_ that signify significant state changes, and broadcast them to
_listeners_ that have registered an interest in receiving events of the
type indicated by the event’s implementation class. At the end of
several phases of the request processing lifecycle, the JSF
implementation will broadcast all of the events that have been queued to
interested listeners. As of JSF version 2, the specification also
defines _system events_ . System events are events that are not specific
to any particular application, but rather stem from specific points in
time of running a JSF application. The following UML class diagram
illustrates the key players in the event model. Boxes shaded in gray
indicate classes or interfaces defined outside of the
_javax.faces.event_ package.



image:SF-18.png[image]

=== [[a1306]]Application Events

Application events are events that are
specific to a particular application. Application events are the
standard events that have been in JSF from the beginning.

=== [[a1308]]Event Classes

All events that are broadcast by JSF user
interface components must extend the _javax.faces.event.FacesEvent_
abstract base class. The parameter list for the constructor(s) of this
event class must include a _UIComponent_ , which identifies the
component from which the event will be broadcast to interested
listeners. The source component can be retrieved from the event object
itself by calling _getComponent_ . Additional constructor parameters
and/or properties on the event class can be used to relay additional
information about the event.

In conformance to the naming patterns defined
in the _JavaBeans Specification_ , event classes typically have a class
name that ends with _Event_ . It is recommended that application event
classes follow this naming pattern as well.

The component that is the source of a
FacesEvent can be retrieved via this method:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public UIComponent getComponent();
|===

 _FacesEvent_ has a _phaseId_ property (of
type _PhaseId_ , see link:JSF.html#a1335[See Phase Identifiers])
used to identify the request processing lifecycle phase after which the
event will be delivered to interested listeners.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public PhaseId getPhaseId();



public void setPhaseId(PhaseId phaseId);

|===

If this property is set to PhaseId.ANY_PHASE
(which is the default), the event will be delivered at the end of the
phase in which it was enqueued.

To facilitate general management of event
listeners in JSF components, a _FacesEvent_ implementation class must
support the following methods:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public abstract boolean
isAppropriateListener(FacesListener listener);



public abstract void
processListener(FacesListener listener);

|===

The _isAppropriateListener()_ method returns
true if the specified _FacesListener_ is a relevant receiver of this
type of event. Typically, this will be implemented as a simple
“instanceof” check to ensure that the listener class implements the
_FacesListener_ subinterface that corresponds to this event class

The _processListener()_ method must call the
appropriate event processing method on the specified listener.
Typically, this will be implemented by casting the listener to the
corresponding _FacesListener_ subinterface and calling the appropriate
event processing method, passing this event instance as a parameter.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void queue();
|===

The above convenience method calls the
_queueEvent()_ method of the source _UIComponent_ for this event,
passing this event as a parameter.

JSF includes two standard _FacesEvent_
subclasses, which are emitted by the corresponding standard
_UIComponent_ subclasses described in the following chapter.

 _ActionEvent—_ Emitted by a _UICommand_
component when the user activates the corresponding user interface
control (such as a clicking a button or a hyperlink).

 _ValueChangeEvent_ —Emitted by a _UIInput_
component (or appropriate subclass) when a new local value has been
created, and has passed all validations.

=== [[a1329]]Listener Classes

For each event type that may be emitted, a
corresponding listener interface must be created, which extends the
_javax.faces.event.FacesListener_ interface. The method signature(s)
defined by the listener interface must take a single parameter, an
instance of the event class for which this listener is being created. A
listener implementation class will implement one or more of these
listener interfaces, along with the event handling method(s) specified
by those interfaces. The event handling methods will be called during
event broadcast, one per event.

In conformance to the naming patterns defined
in the _JavaBeans Specification_ , listener interfaces have a class name
based on the class name of the event being listened to, but with the
word _Listener_ replacing the trailing _Event_ of the event class name
(thus, the listener for a _FooEvent_ would be a _FooListener_ ). It is
recommended that application event listener interfaces follow this
naming pattern as well.

Corresponding to the two standard event
classes described in the previous section, JSF defines two standard
event listener interfaces that may be implemented by application
classes:

 _ActionListener_ —a listener that is
interested in receiving _ActionEvent_ events.

 _ValueChangeListener_ —a listener that is
interested in receiving _ValueChangeEvent_ events.

=== [[a1335]]Phase Identifiers

As described in
link:JSF.html#a494[See Common Event Processing], event handling
occurs at the end of several phases of the request processing lifecycle.
In addition, a particular event must indicate, through the value it
returns from the _getPhaseId()_ method, the phase in which it wishes to
be delivered. This indication is done by returning an instance of
_javax.faces.event.PhaseId_ . The class defines a typesafe enumeration
of all the legal values that may be returned by _getPhaseId()_ . In
addition, a special value ( _PhaseId.ANY_PHASE_ ) may be returned to
indicate that this event wants to be delivered at the end of the phase
in which it was queued.

=== Listener Registration

A concrete _UIComponent_ subclass that emits
events of a particular type must include public methods to register and
deregister a listener implementation. [P1-start listener methods must
conform to javabeans naming] In order to be recognized by development
tools, these listener methods must follow the naming patterns defined in
the _JavaBeans Specification_ . [P1-end] For example, for a component
that emits _FooEvent_ events, to be received by listeners that implement
the _FooListener_ interface, the method signatures (on the component
class) must be:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void addFooListener(FooListener
listener);



public FooListener[] getFooListeners();



public void removeFooListener(FooListener
listener);

|===

The application (or other components) may
register listener instances at any time, by calling the appropriate add
method. The set of listeners associated with a component is part of the
state information that JSF saves and restores. Therefore, listener
implementation classes must have a public zero-argument constructor, and
may implement _StateHolder_ (see link:JSF.html#a1138[See
StateHolder]) if they have internal state information that needs to be
saved and restored.

The _UICommand_ and _UIInput_ standard
component classes include listener registration and deregistration
methods for event listeners associated with the event types that they
emit. The _UIInput_ methods are also inherited by _UIInput_ subclasses,
including _UISelectBoolean_ , _UISelectMany_ , and _UISelectOne_ .

=== Event Queueing

During the processing being performed by any
phase of the request processing lifecycle, events may be created and
queued by calling the _queueEvent()_ method on the source _UIComponent_
instance, or by calling the _queue()_ method on the _FacesEvent_
instance itself. As described in link:JSF.html#a494[See Common
Event Processing], at the end of certain phases of the request
processing lifecycle, any queued events will be broadcast to interested
listeners in the order that the events were originally queued.

Deferring event broadcast until the end of a
request processing lifecycle phase ensures that the entire component
tree has been processed by that state, and that event listeners all see
the same consistent state of the entire tree, no matter when the event
was actually queued.

=== [[a1349]]Event Broadcasting

As described in
link:JSF.html#a494[See Common Event Processing], at the end of
each request processing lifecycle phase that may cause events to be
queued, the lifecycle management method of the _UIViewRoot_ component at
the root of the component tree will iterate over the queued events and
call the _broadcast()_ method on the source component instance to
actually notify the registered listeners. See the Javadocs of the
_broadcast()_ method for detailed functional requirements.

During event broadcasting, a listener
processing an event may:

Examine or modify the state of any component
in the component tree.

Add or remove components from the component
tree.

Add messages to be returned to the user, by
calling _addMessage_ on the _FacesContext_ instance for the current
request.

Queue one or more additional events, from the
same source component or a different one, for processing during the
current lifecycle phase.

Throw an _AbortProcessingException_ , to tell
the JSF implementation that no further broadcast of this event should
take place.

Call _renderResponse()_ on the _FacesContext_
instance for the current request. This tells the JSF implementation
that, when the current phase of the request processing lifecycle has
been completed, control should be transferred to the _Render Response_
phase.

Call _responseComplete()_ on the
_FacesContext_ instance for the current request. This tells the JSF
implementation that, when the current phase of the request processing
lifecycle has been completed, processing for this request should be
terminated (because the actual response content has been generated by
some other means).

=== [[a1359]]System Events

System Events are introduced in version 2 of
the specification and represent specific points in time for a JSF
application. _PhaseEvent_ s also represent specific points in time in a
JSF application, but the granularity they offer is not as precise as
System Events. For more on _PhaseEvent_ s, please see
link:JSF.html#a6626[See PhaseEvent].

=== [[a1361]]Event Classes

All system events extend from the base class
_SystemEvent_ . _SystemEvent_ has a similar API to _FacesEvent_ , but
the _source_ of the event is of type _Object_ (instead of _UIComponent_
), _SystemEvent_ has no _PhaseId_ property and _SystemEvent_ has no
_queue()_ method because _SystemEvent_ s are never queued. _SystemEvent_
shares _isAppropriateListener()_ _and processListener()_ with
_FacesEvent_ . __ For the specification of these methods see
_link:JSF.html#a1308[See Event Classes]_ .

System events that originate from or are
associated with specific component instances should extend from
_ComponentSystemEvent_ , which extends _SystemEvent_ and adds a
_getComponent()_ method, as specififed in
_link:JSF.html#a1308[See Event Classes]_ .

The specification defines the following
_SystemEvent_ subclasses, all in package _javax.faces.event_ . __

 _ExceptionQueuedEvent_ indicates a
non-expected _Exception_ has been thrown. Please see
link:JSF.html#a3253[See ExceptionHandler] for the normative
specification.

 _PostConstructApplicationEvent_ must be
published immediately after application startup. Please see
link:JSF.html#a6201[See Application Startup Behavior] for the
normative specification.

 _PreDestroyApplicationEvent_ must be
published as immediately before application shutdown. Please see
link:JSF.html#a6248[See Application Shutdown Behavior] for the
normative specification

 _PostKeepFlashEvent_ This event must be
published by a call to _Application.publishEvent()_ when a value is kept
in the flash.

 _PostPutFlashEvent_ This event must be
published by a call to _Application.publishEvent()_ when a value is
stored in the flash.

 _PreClearFlashEvent_ This event must be
published by a call to _Application.publishEvent()_ when a before the
flash is cleared.

 _PreRemoveFlashEvent_ This event must be
published by a call to _Application.publishEvent()_ when a value is
removed from the flash.

The specification defines the following
_ComponentSystemEvent_ classes, all in package _javax.faces.event_ .

 _InitialStateEvent_ must be published with a
direct call to _UIComponent.processEvent()_ , during the _apply()_
method of the class _javax.faces.webapp.vdl.ComponentHandler_ . Please
see the javadocs for the normative specification.

 _PostAddToViewEvent_ indicates that the
_source_ component has just been added to the view. Please see
link:JSF.html#a937[See Component Tree Manipulation] for a
reference to the normative specification.

 _PostConstructViewMapEvent_ indicates that
the _Map_ that is the view scope has just been created. Please see, the
UIViewRoot link:JSF.html#a2268[See Events] for a
reference to the normative specification.

PostRenderViewEvent indicates that the
UIViewRoot source component has just been rendered. Please see Section
2.2.6 “Render Response” for the normative specification.

PostRestoreStateEvent indicates that an
individual component instance has just had its state restored. Please
see the _UIViewRoot_ link:JSF.html#a2268[See Events]
for a reference to the normative specification.

PostValidateEvent indicates that an
individual component instance has just been validated. Please see the
_EditableValueHolder_ link:JSF.html#a1223[See Events] for the
normative specification.

 _PreDestroyViewMapEvent_ indicates that the
_Map_ that is the view scope is about to be destroyed. Please see, the
UIViewRoot link:JSF.html#a2230[See Properties] for the normative
specification.

 _PreRenderComponentEvent_ indicates that the
_source_ component is about to be rendered. Please see
link:JSF.html#a937[See Component Tree Manipulation] for a
reference to the normative specification.

 _PreRenderViewEvent_ indicates that the
_UIViewRoot_ source component is about to be rendered. Please see
link:JSF.html#a457[See Render Response] for the normative
specification.

PreValidateEvent indicates that an individual
component instance is about to be validated. Please see the
_EditableValueHolder_ link:JSF.html#a1223[See Events] for the
normative specification.

=== Listener Classes

Unlike application events, the creation of
new event types for system events does not require the creation of new
listener interfaces. All _SystemEvent_ types can be listened for by
listeners that implement _javax.faces.event.SystemEventListener_ .
Please see the javadocs for that class for the complete specification.

As a developer convenience, the listener
interface _ComponentSystemEventListener_ has been defined for those
cases when a _SystemEventListener_ is being attached to a specific
_UIComponent_ instance. _ComponentSystemEventListener_ lacks the
_isListenerForSource()_ method because it is implcictly defined by
virture of the listener being added to a specific component instance.

=== Programmatic Listener Registration

System events may be listened for at the
Application level, using _Application.subscribeToEvent()_ or at the
component level, by calling _subscribeToEvent()_ on a specific component
instance. The specification for _Application.subscribeToEvent()_ may be
found in _link:JSF.html#a3526[See System Event Methods]_ .

The following methods are defined on
_UIComponent_ to support per-component system events.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void subscribeToEvent(Class<? extends
SystemEvent> eventClass, ComponentSystemEventListener
componentListener);

public void unsubscribeFromEvent(Class<?
extends SystemEvent> eventClass, ComponentSystemEventListener
componentListener);

|===

See the javadoc for _UIComponent_ for the
normative specification of these methods.

In addition to the above methods, the
_@ListenerFor_ and _@ListenersFor_ annotations allow components,
renderers, validators and converters to declare that they want to
register for system events. Please see the javadocs for those
annotations for the complete specification.

=== [[a1393]]Declarative Listener Registration

Page authors can subscribe to events using
the <f:event/> tag. This tag will allow the application developer to
specify the method to be called when the specifed event fires for the
component of which the tag is a child. The tag usage is as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<h:inputText value="#\{myBean.text}">

 <f:event type="preRenderComponent"

 listener="#\{myBean.beforeTextRender}" />

</h:inputText>

|===

The _type_ attribute specifies the type of
event, and can be any of the specification-defined events or one of any
user-defined events, but must be a _ComponentSystemEvent_ , using either
the short-hand name for the event or the fully-qualified class name
(e.g., _com.foo.app.event.CustomEvent_ ). If the event can not be found,
a _FacesException_ listing the offending event type will be thrown.
Please see the VDLDocs for the _<f:event />_ tag for the normative
specification of the declarative event feature.

The method signature for the
_MethodExpression_ pointed to by the _listener_ attribute must match the
signature of
_javax.faces.event.ComponentSystemEventListener.processEvent()_ , which
is:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void
processEvent(javax.faces.event.ComponentSystemEvent event) throws
AbortProcessingException.
|===



=== [[a1403]]Listener Registration By Annotation

The _ListenerFor_ and _ListenersFor_
annotations can be applied to components and rendererers. Classes tagged
with the _ListenerFor_ annotation are installed as listeners. The
_ListenersFor_ annotation is a container annotation tp specify multiple
_ListenerFor_ annotations for a single class. Please refer to the
Javadocs for the _ListenerFor_ and _ListenersFor classes for more
details._

=== Listener Registration By Application Configuration Resources

A _<system-event-listener>_ element, within
the _<application>_ element of an application configuration resource,
declares an application scoped listener and causes a call to
_Application.subscribeToEvent()_ .

=== Event Broadcasting

System events are broadcast immediately by
calls to _Application.publishEvent()_ Please see
link:JSF.html#a3526[See System Event Methods] for the normative
specification of _publishEvent()_ .

[[a1410]]Validation Model

This section describes the facilities
provided by JavaServer Faces for validating user input.

=== Overview

JSF supports a mechanism for registering zero
or more _validators_ on each _EditableValueHolder_ component in the
component tree. A validator’s purpose is to perform checks on the local
value of the component, during the _Process Validations_ phase of the
request processing lifecycle. In addition, a component may implement
internal checking in a _validate_ method that is part of the component
class.

=== [[a1414]]Validator Classes

A validator must implement the
_javax.faces.validator.Validator_ interface, which contains a
_validate()_ method signature.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
| _public void validate(FacesContext context,
UIComponent component, Object value);_
|===

General purpose validators may require
configuration values in order to define the precise check to be
performed. For example, a validator that enforces a maximum length might
wish to support a configurable length limit. Such configuration values
are typically implemented as JavaBeans component properties, and/or
constructor arguments, on the _Validator_ implementation class. In
addition, a validator may elect to use generic attributes of the
component being validated for configuration information.

JSF includes implementations of several
standard validators, as described in link:JSF.html#a1446[See
Standard Validator Implementations].

=== [[a1419]]Validation Registration

The _EditableValueHolder_ interface
(implemented by _UIInput_ ) includes an _addValidator_ method to
register an additional validator for this component, and a
_removeValidator_ method to remove an existing registration. In JSF 1.1
there was the ability to set a _MethodBinding_ that points to a method
that adheres to the _validate_ signature in the _Validator_ interface,
which will be called after the Validator instances added by calling
addValidator() have been invoked. In JSF 1.2, this has been replaced by
providing a new wrapper class that implements _Validator_ , and accepts
a _MethodExpression_ instance that points to the same method that the
_MethodBinding_ pointed to in JSF 1.1. Please see the javadocs for
_EditableValueHolder.setValidator()_ .

The application (or other components) may
register validator instances at any time, by calling the _addValidator_
method. The set of validators associated with a component is part of the
state information that JSF saves and restores. Validators that wish to
have configuration properties saved and restored must also implement
_StateHolder_ (see link:JSF.html#a1138[See StateHolder]).

In addition to validators which are
registered explicitly on the component, either through the Java API or
in the view markup, zero or more “default validators” can be declared in
the application configuration resources, which will be registered on all
_UIInput_ instances in the component tree unless explicitly disabled.
[P1-start-validator-reg]The default validators are appended after any
locally defined validators once the _EditableValueHolder_ is populated
and added to the component tree. A default validator must not be added
to a _UIInput_ if a validator having the same id is already present.

The typical way of registering a default
validator id is by declaring it in a configuration resource, as follows:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
 _<faces-config>_

 < _application>_

 < _default-validators>_


_<validator-id>javax.faces.Bean</validator-id>_

</ _default-validators>_

 < _application/>_

 _</faces-config>_



|===

A default validator may also be registered
using the _isDefault_ attribute on the _@FacesValidator_ annotation on a
_Validator_ class, as specified in link:JSF.html#a6598[See
Requirements for scanning of classes for annotations].

The during application startup, the runtime
must cause any default validators declared either in the application
configuration resources, or via a _@FacesValidator_ annotation with
_isDefault_ set to _true_ to be added with a call to
_Application.addDefaultValidatorId()_ . This method is declared in
link:JSF.html#a3510[See Default Validator Ids].

Any configuration resource that declares a
list of default validators overrides any list provided in a previously
processed configuration resource. If an empty _<default-validators/>_
element is found in a configuration resource, the list of default
validators must be cleared.

In environments that include Bean Validation,
the following additional actions must be taken at startup time. If the
_javax.faces.validator.DISABLE_DEFAULT_BEAN_VALIDATOR_ _<context-param>_
exists and its value is _true_ , the following step must be skipped:

{empty}The runtime must guarantee that the
validator id _javax.faces.Bean_ is included in the result from a call to
_Application.getDefaultValidatorInfo()_ (see
link:JSF.html#a3510[See Default Validator Ids]), regardless of
any configuration found in the application configuration resources or
via the _@FacesValidator_ annotation.[P1-end]

=== Validation Processing

During the _Process Validations_ phase of the
request processing lifecycle (as described in
link:JSF.html#a438[See Process Validations]), the JSF
implementation will ensure that the _validate()_ method of each
registered _Validator_ , the method referenced by the _validator_
property (if any), and the _validate_ () method of the component itself,
is called for each _EditableValueHolder_ component in the component
tree, regardless of the validity state of any of the components in the
tree. The responsibilities of each _validate()_ method include:

Perform the check for which this validator
was registered.

If violation(s) of the correctness rules are
found, create a _FacesMessage_ instance describing the problem, and
create a _ValidatorException_ around it, and throw the
_ValidatorException_ . The _EditableValueHolder_ on which this
validation is being performed will catch this exception, set _valid_ to
_false_ for that instance, and cause the message to be added to the
_FacesContext_ .

In addition, a _validate()_ method may:

Examine or modify the state of any component
in the component tree.

Add or remove components from the component
tree.

Queue one or more events, from the same
component or a different one, for processing during the current
lifecycle phase.

The render-independent property _required_ is
a shorthand for the function of a “required” validator. If the value of
this property is true, there is an entry in the request payload
corresponding to this component, and the component has no value, the
component is marked invalid and a message is added to the _FacesContext_
instance. See link:JSF.html#a584[See Localized Application
Messages] for details on the message.

=== [[a1446]]Standard Validator Implementations

JavaServer Faces defines a standard suite of
_Validator_ implementations that perform a variety of commonly required
checks. In addition, component writers, application developers, and tool
providers will often define additional _Validator_ implementations that
may be used to support component-type-specific or application-specific
constraints. These implementations share the following common
characteristics:

Standard _Validators_ accept configuration
information as either parameters to the constructor that creates a new
instance of that _Validator_ , or as JavaBeans component properties on
the _Validator_ implementation class.

To support internationalization,
_FacesMessage_ instances should be created. The message identifiers for
such standard messages are also defined by manifest String constants in
the implementation classes. It is the user’s responsibility to ensure
the content of a _FacesMessage_ instance is properly localized, and
appropriate parameter substitution is performed, perhaps using
_java.text.MessageFormat_ .

See the javadocs for
_UIInput.validateValue()_ for further normative specification regarding
validation.

Concrete Validator implementations must
define a public static final String constant VALIDATOR_ID, whose value
is the standard identifier under which the JSF implementation must
register this instance (see below).

Please see link:JSF.html#a584[See
Localized Application Messages] for the list of message identifiers.

[P1-start standard validators] The following
standard _Validator_ implementations (in the _javax.faces.validator_
package) are provided:

 _DoubleRangeValidator_ —Checks the local
value of a component, which must be of any numeric type, against
specified maximum and/or minimum values. Standard identifier is
“javax.faces.DoubleRange”.

 _LengthValidator_ —Checks the length (i.e.
number of characters) of the local value of a component, which must be
of type _String_ , against maximum and/or minimum values. Standard
identifier is “javax.faces.Length”.

 _LongRangeValidator_ —Checks the local value
of a component, which must be of any numeric type convertible to _long_
, against maximum and/or minimum values. Standard identifier is
“javax.faces.LongRange”.

 _RegexValidator_ —Accepts a “pattern”
attribute that is interpreted as a regular expression from the
_java.util.regex_ package. The local value of the component is checked
fora match against this regular expression. Standard identifier is
“javax.faces.RegularExpression”

 _BeanValidator_ - The implementation must
ensure that this validator is only available when running in an
environment in which JSR-303 Beans Validation is available. Please see
the javadocs for _BeanValidator.validate()_ for the
specification.Standard identifier is “javax.faces.Bean”

RequiredValidator - Analogous to setting the
required attribute to true on the EditableValueHolder. Enforces that the
local value is not empty. Reuses the logic and error messages defined on
UIInput. The standard identifier for this validator is
"javax.faces.Required"

{empty} _MethodExpressionValidator_ —Wraps a
_MethodExpression_ and interprets it as pointing to a method that
performs validation. Any exception thrown when the expression is invoked
is wrapped in a _ValidatorException_ in similar fashion as the above
validators. [P1-end]

=== [[a1461]]Bean Validation Integration

If the implementation is running in a
container environment that requires Bean Validation, it must expose the
bean validation as described in this specification.

As stated in the specification goals of JSR
303, validation often gets spread out across the application, from user
interface components to persistent objects. Bean Validation strives to
avoid this duplication by defining a set of metadata that can be used to
express validation constraints that are sharable by any layer of the
application. Since its inception, JSF has supported a “field level
validation” approach. Rather than requiring the developer to define
validators for each input component (i.e., _EditableValueHolder_ ), the
BeanValidator can be automatically applied to all fields on a page so
that the work of enforcing the constraints can be delegated to the Bean
Validation provider.

=== [[a1464]]Bean Validator Activation

[P1-BeanValidationIntegration]If Bean
Validation is present in the runtime environment, the system must ensure
that the standard validator with validator-id _javax.faces.Bean_ is
added with a call to _Application.addDefaultValidatorId()_ .[P1-end] See
link:JSF.html#a1446[See Standard Validator Implementations] for
the description of the standard _BeanValidator_ , and
link:JSF.html#a5828[See <f:validateBean>] for the Facelet tag
that exposes this validator to the page author. This ensures Bean
Validation will be called for every field in the application.

If Bean Validation is present, and the
_javax.faces.VALIDATE_EMPTY_FIELDS_ _<context-param>_ is not explicitly
set to _false_ , JSF will validate _null_ and empty fields so that the
_@NotNull_ and _@NotEmpty_ constraints from Bean Validation can be
leveraged. The next section describes how the reference to the Bean
Validation ValidatorFactory is obtained by that validator.

=== [[a1467]]Obtaining a ValidatorFactory

The Bean Validation ValidatorFactory is the
main entry point into Bean Validation and is responsible for creating
Validator instances. [P1-start-validatoryfactory]A ValidatorFactory is
retrieved using the following algorithm:

If the servlet context contains a
ValidatorFactory instance under the attribute named
javax.faces.validator.beanValidator.ValidatorFactory, this instance is
used by JSF to acquire Validator instances (specifically in the
BeanValidator). This key should be defined in the constant named
VALIDATOR_FACTORY_KEY on BeanValidator.

If the servlet context does not contain such
an entry, JSF looks for a Bean Validation provider in the classpath. If
present, the standard Bean Validation bootstrap strategy is used. If not
present, Bean Validation integration is disabled. If the BeanValidator
is used an no ValidatorFactory can be retrieved, a FacesException is
raised. The standard Bean Validation bootstrap procedure is shown here:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|ValidatorFactory validatorFactory =
Validation.buildDefaultValidatorFactory();
|===

{empty}Once instantiated, the result can be
stored in the servlet context attribute mentioned as a means of caching
the result. If JSF is running in an EE6 environment, Bean Validation
will be available, as defined by the EE6 specification, and thus
activated in JSF. The EE container will be responsible for making the
ValidatorFactory available as an attribute in the ServletContext as
mentioned above.[P1-end]

=== Class-Level Validation

JSF conversion and validation as described in
this chapter operates on the principle that all conversion and
validation is performed before values are pushed into the model. This
principle allows one to safely assume that if a value is pushed into the
model, it is of the proper type and has been validated. This validation
is done on a “field level” basis, as mentioned in
link:JSF.html#a1461[See Bean Validation Integration]. This
approach poses challenges for higher level validation that needs to take
the value of several fields together into account to decide if they are
valid or not. For example, consider the common case of a user account
creation page with two fields for the password. The page can only be
considered valid if both password fields are themselves individually
valid based on the specified password constraints and also are both the
same value. JSF provides for this case by providing a facility for
performing Class-Level Validation using Bean Validation. Please see the
VDLDoc for the _<f:validateWholeBean />_ tag for the normative
specification of this feature as well as a usage example showing the
password validation scenario.

=== Localization of Bean Validation Messages

To ensure proper localization of the
messages, JSF should provide a custom BeanValidation MessageInterpolator
resolving the Locale according to JSF defaults and delegating to the
default MessageInterpolator as defined in
ValidationFactory.getMessageInterpolator(). A possible implementation is
shown here:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public class JsfMessageInterpolator
implements MessageInterpolator \{



private final MessageInterpolator delegate;



public
JsfMessageInterpolator(MessageInterpolator delegate) \{

 this.delegate = delegate;

 }



 public String interpolate(String message,
ConstraintDescriptor constraintDescriptor,Object value) \{

 Locale locale =
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getViewRoot().

getLocale();

return this.delegate.interpolate(

message, constraintDescriptor, value, locale
);

 }



 public String interpolate(String message,
ConstraintDescriptor constraintDescriptor, Object value, Locale locale)
\{

 return this.delegate.interpolate(message,
constraintDescriptor, value, locale);

}

}



|===

Once a ValidatorFactory is obtained, as
described in link:JSF.html#a1467[See Obtaining a
ValidatorFactory], JSF receives a Validator instance by providing the
custom message interpolator to the validator state.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
//could be cached

MessageInterpolator jsfMessageInterpolator =
new JsfMessageInterpolator(

validatorFactory.getMessageInterpolator() );



//...



Validator validator = validatorFactory

 .usingContext()

 .messageInterpolator(jsfMessageInterpolator)

 .getValidator();



|===

The local value is then passed to the
Validator.validateValue() method to check for constraint violations.
Since Bean Validation defines a strategy for localized message
reporting, the BeanValidator does not need to concern itself with
producing the validation message. Instead, the BeanValidator should
accept the interpolated message returned from Bean Validation API, which
is accessed via the method getInterpolatedMessage() on the
ContraintFailure class, and use it as the replacement value for the
first numbered placeholder for the key
javax.faces.validator.BeanValidator.MESSAGE (i.e., \{0}). To encourage
use of the Bean Validation message facility, the default message format
string for the BeanValidator message key must be a single placeholder,
as shown here:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|javax.faces.validator.BeanValidator.MESSAGE=\{0}
|===

Putting the Bean Validation message
resolution in full control of producing the displayed message is the
recommended approach. However, to allow the developer to align the
messages generated by the BeanValidator with existing JSF 1.2
validators, the developer may choose to override this message key in an
application resource bundle and reference the component label, which
replaces the second numbered placeholder (i.e., \{1}).

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|javax.faces.validator.BeanValidator.MESSAGE=\{1}:
\{0}
|===

This approach is useful if you are already
using localized labels for your input components and are displaying the
messages above the form, rather than adjacent to the input.

[[a1515]]Composite User Interface Components

=== Non-normative Background

To aid implementors in providing a spec
compliant runtime for composite components, this section provides a
non-normative background to motivate the discussion of the composite
component feature. The composite component feature enables developers to
write real, reusable, JSF UI components without any Java code or
configuration XML.

=== [[a1518]]What does it mean to be a JSF User Interface component?

JSF is a component based framework, and JSF
UI components are the main point of JSF. But what is a JSF UI component,
really? Conceptually, a JSF UI Component is a software artifact that
represents a reusable, self contained piece of a user interface. A very
narrow definition for “JSF UI Component” is imposed at runtime. This
definition can be summarized as

A JSF UI Component is represented at runtime
by an instance of a Java class that includes
_javax.faces.component.UIComponent_ as an ancestor in its inheritance
hierarchy.

It is easy to write a class that adheres to
this definition, but in practice, component authors need to do more than
just this in order to get the most from JSF and to conform to user’s
expectations of what a JSF UI Component is. For example, users expect a
JSF UI Component can do some or all of the following:

be exposed to the page-author via a markup
tag with sensible attributes

emit events (such a _ValueChangeEvent_ or
_ActionEvent_ )

allow attaching listeners

allow attaching a _Converter_ and/or
_Validator_ (s)

render itself to the user-agent, with full
support for styles, localization and accessibility

support delegated rendering to allow for
client device independence

read values sent from the user-agent and
correctly adapt them to the faces lifecycle

correctly handle saving and restoring its
state across multiple requests from the user-agent

Another important dimension to consider
regarding UI components is the context in which the developer interacts
with the component. There are generally two such contexts.

In the context of a markup view, such as a
JSP or Facelet view. In this context the developer interacts with the UI
component using a markup element, setting attributes on that element,
and nesting child elements within that component markup element.

In the context of code, such as a listener, a
managed-bean, or other programming language context. In this context,
the developer is writing JavaCode that is either passed the UI component
as an argument, or obtains a reference to the UI component in some other
way.

=== How does one make a custom JSF User Interface component (JSF 1.2 and earlier)?

To satisfy a user’s expectations for a JSF UI
component, the component author must adhere to one of the following best
practices.

extend the custom component class from an
existing subclass of _UIComponent_ that most closely represents the
meaning and behavior of the piece of the UI you are encapsulating in the
component.

extend the custom component class directly
from _UIComponentBase_ and implement the appropriate “behavioral
interface”(s) that most closely represents the meaning and behavior of
the piece of the UI you are encapsulating in the component. See
link:JSF.html#a1088[See Component Behavioral Interfaces] for
more.

Note that the first best practice includes
the second one “for free” since the stock _UIComponent_ subclasses
already implement the appropriate behavioral interfaces.

When following either best practice, the JSF
UI component developer must follow several steps to make the component
available for use in markup pages or in code, including but not
necessarily limited to

Make entries in a _faces-config.xml_ file,
linking the component class to its _component-type_ , which enables the
_Application.createComponent()_ method to create instances of the
component.

Make entries in a _faces-config.xml_ file to
declare a _Renderer_ that provides client-device independence.

Provide a JSP or Facelet tag handler that
allows the page author to build UIs that include the component, and to
customize each instance of the component with listeners, properties and
model associations. This includes making the association between the
_Renderer_ and the _UIComponent_ .

Provide a _Renderer_ that provides client
device independency for the component

Make entries in a _faces-config.xml_ file
that links the _Renderer_ and its Java class.

These steps are complex, yet the components
one creates by following them can be very flexible and powerful. By
making some simplifying assumptions, it is possible to allow the
creation of components that are just as powerful but require far less
complexity to develop. This is the whole point of composite components:
to enable developers to write real, reusable, JSF UI components without
any Java code or configuration XML.

=== [[a1545]]How does one make a composite component?

The composite component feature builds on two
features introduced in JSF 2.0: resources
(link:JSF.html#a746[See Resource Handling]) and Facelets
(link:JSF.html#a5476[See Facelets and its use in Web
Applications]”). Briefly, a composite component is any Facelet markup
file that resides inside of a resource library. For example, if a
Facelet markup file named _loginPanel.xhtml_ resides inside of a
resource library called _ezcomp_ , then page authors can use this
component by declaring the xml namespace
_xmlns:ez="http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/ezcomp"_ and including the
tag _<ez:loginPanel />_ in their pages. Naturally, it is possible for a
composite component author to declare an alternate XML namespace for
their composite components, but doing so is optional.

Any valid Facelet markup is valid for use
inside of a composite component, including the templating features
specified in
link:JSF.html#a6043[See Facelet
Templating Tag Library]. In addition, the tag library specified in
link:JSF.html#a6045[See Composite Component Tag Library] must be
used to declare the metadata for the composite component. Future
versions of the JSF specification may relax this requirement, but for
now at least the _<composite:interface>_ and
_<composite:implementation>_ sections are required when creating a
composite component.

=== [[a1548]]A simple composite component example

Create the page that uses the composite
component, _index.xhtml_ .

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0
Transitional//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd">

 <f:actionListener for="loginEvent"

 </ez:loginPanel>



</h:form>



</h:body>



</html>

|===

The only thing special about this page is the
_ez_ namespace declaration and the inclusion of the _<ez:loginPanel />_
tag on the page. The occurrence of the string
“http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/” in a Facelet XML namespace
declaration means that whatever follows that last “ _/_ ” is taken to be
the name of a resource library. For any usage of this namespace in the
page, such as _<ez:loginPanel />_ , a Facelet markup file with the
corresponding name is loaded and taken to be the composite component, in
this case the file _loginPanel.xhtml_ . The implementation requirements
for this and other Facelet features related to composite components are
specified in link:JSF.html#a5661[See Requirements specific to
composite components].

Create the composite component markup page.
In this case, _loginPanel.xhtml_ resides in the _./resources/ezcomp_
directory relative to the _index.xhtml_ file.

|===

The _<composite:interface>_ section declares
the public interface that users of this component need to understand. In
this case, the component declares that it contains an implementation of
_ActionSource2_ (see link:JSF.html#a1120[See ActionSource2]),
and therefore anything one can do with an _ActionSource2_ in a Facelet
markup page you one do with the composite component. (See
link:JSF.html#a1088[See Component Behavioral Interfaces] for
more on _ActionSource2_ and other behavioral interfaces). The
_<composite:implementation>_ section defines the implementation of this
composite component.

=== Walk through of the run-time for the simple composite component example

This section gives a non-normative traversal
of the composite component feature using the previous example as a
guide. Please refer to the javadocs for the normative specification for
each method mentioned below. Any text in _italics_ is a term defined in
link:JSF.html#a1619[See Composite Component Terms].

The user-agent requests the _index.html_ from
link:JSF.html#a1548[See A simple composite component example].
This page contains the
‘xmlns:ez="http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/ezcomp"‘ declaration and an
occurrence of the _<ez:loginPanel>_ tag. Because this page contains a
usage of a composite component, it is called a _using page_ for
discussion.

The runtime notices the use of an xml
namespace beginning with “http://java.sun.com/jsf/composite/”. Takes the
substring of the namespace after the last “/”, exclusive, and looks for
a resource library with the name “ _ezcomp_ ” by calling
_ResourceHandler.libraryExists()_ .

The runtime encounters the _<ez:loginPanel>_
component in the _using page_ . This causes
_Application.createComponent(FacesContext, Resource)_ to be called. This
method instantiates the _top level component_ but does not populate it
with children. Pay careful attention to the javadocs for this method.
Depending on the circumstances, the _top level component_ instance can
come from a developer supplied Java Class, a Script, or an
implementation specific java class. This method calls
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.getComponentMetadata(FacesContext, Resource)_ ,
which obtains the _composite component BeanInfo_ (and therefore also the
_composite component BeanDescriptor_ ) that exposes the _composite
component metadata_ . The _composite component metadata_ also includes
any _attached object targets_ exposed by the _composite component
author_ . One thing that _Application.createComponent(FacesContext,
Resource)_ does to the component before returning it is set the
component’s renderer type to be _javax.faces.Composite_ . This is
important during rendering.

Again,
_Application.createComponent(FacesContext, Resource)_ does not populate
the _top level component_ with children. Subsequent processing done as
the runtime traverses the rest of the page takes care of that. One very
important aspect of that subsequent processing is ensuring that all of
the _UIComponent_ children in the _defining page_ are placed in a facet
underneath the _top level component_ . The name of that facet is given
by the _UIComponent.COMPOSITE_FACET_NAME_ constant.

After the children of the _composite
component tag_ in the _using page_ have been processed by the VDL
implementation, the VDL implementation must call
_VDLUtils.retargetAttachedObjects()_ . This method examines the
_composite component metadata_ and retargets any attached objects from
the _using page_ to their approriate _inner component_ targets.

Because the renderer type of the composite
component was set to _javax.faces.Composite_ , the _composite component
renderer_ is invoked to render the composite component.

=== [[a1619]]Composite Component Terms

The following terms are commonly used to
describe the composite component feature.



Attached Object

Any artifact that can be attached to a
_UIComponent_ (composite or otherwise). Usually, this means a
_Converter_ , _Validator_ , _ActionListener_ , or _ValueChangeListener_
.

Attached Object Target

Part of the _composite component metadata_
that allows the _composite component author_ to expose the semantics of
an inner component to the _using page author_ without exposing the
rendering or implementation details of the inner component.

Composite Component

a _top level component_ , that can be thought of and used as a single
component in a view. The component hierarchy of this subtree is
described in the _composite component defining page_ .

Composite Component Author

The individual or role creating the
_composite component_ . This usually involves authoring the _composite
component defining page_ .

Composite Component _BeanDescriptor_

A constituent element of the _composite
component metadata_ . This version of the spec uses the JavaBeans API to
expose the component metadata for the composite component. Future
versions of the spec may use a different API to expose the component
metadata.

Composite Component _BeanInfo_

The main element of the _composite component_
_metadata_ .

Composite Component Declaration

The section of markup within the _composite
component defining page_ that includes the _<composite:interface>_
section and its children.

Composite Component Definition

The section of markup within the _composite
component defining page_ that includes the _<composite:implementation>_
section and its children.

Composite Component Library

A resource library that contains a _defining
page_ for each _composite component_ that the _composite component
author_ wishes to expose to the _using page author_ .

Composite Component Metadata

Any data about the _composite component_ .
The normative specification for what must be in the _composite component
metadata_ is in the javadocs for
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.getComponentMetadata()_ .

Composite Component Renderer

A new renderer in the _HTML_BASIC_ render kit
that knows how to render a _composite component_ .

Composite Component Tag

The tag in the _using page_ that references a
_composite component_ declared and defined in a _defining page_ .

Defining page

The markup page, usually Facelets markup,
that contains the _composite component declaration_ and _composite
component definition_ .

Inner Component

Any _UIComponent_ inside of the _defining
page_ or a page that is referenced from the _defining page_ .

Top level component

The _UIComponent_ instance in the tree that
is the parent of all _UIComponent_ instances within the _defining page_
and any pages used by that _defining page_ .

Using Page

The VDL page in which a _composite component
tag_ is used.

Using Page Author

The individual or role that creates pages
that use the _composite component_ .

=== [[a1671]]Composite Component Metadata

In the current version of the specification,
only composite _UIComponent_ s must have component metadata. It is
possible that future versions of the specification will broaden this
requirement so that all _UIComponent_ s must have metadata.

This section describes the implementation of
the _composite component metadata_ that is returned from the method
_ViewDeclarationLanguage.getComponentMetadata()_ . This method is
formally declared in link:JSF.html#a4046[See
ViewDeclarationLanguage.getComponentMetadata()], but for reference its
signature is repeated here.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public BeanInfo
getComponentMetadata(FacesContext context, Resource componentResource)
|===

The specification requires that this method
is called from _Application.createComponent(FacesContext context,
Resource componentResource)_ . See the javadocs for that method for
actions that must be taken based on the composite component metadata
returned from _getComponentMetadata()_ .

The default implementation of this method
must support authoring the component metadata using tags placed inside
of a _<composite:interface />_ element found on a _defining page_ . This
element is specified in the Facelets taglibrary docs.

Composite component metadata currently
consists of the following information:

The _composite component BeanInfo_ , returned
from this method.

The _Resource_ from which the composite
component was created.

The _composite component BeanDescriptor_ .

This _BeanDescriptor_ must be returned when
_getBeanDescriptor()_ is called on the composite component _BeanInfo_ .

The composite component _BeanDescriptor_
exposes the following information.

The “name” attributes of the
_<composite:interface/ >_ element is exposed using the corresponding
method on the composite component _BeanDescriptor_ . If _ProjectStage_
is _Development_ , The “displayName”, “shortDescription”, “expert”,
“hidden”, and “preferred” attributes of the _<composite:interface/ >_
element are exposed using the corresponding methods on the composite
component _BeanDescriptor_ . Any additional attributes on
_<composite:interface/ >_ are exposed as attributes accessible from the
_getValue()_ and _attributeNames()_ methods on _BeanDescriptor_
(inherited from _FeatureDescriptor_ ). The return type from _getValue()_
must be a _javax.el.ValueExpression_ for such attributes.

The list of exposed _AttachedObjectTarget_ s
to which the _page author_ can attach things such as listeners,
converters, or validators.

The VDL implementation must populate the
composite component metadata with a _List<AttachedObjectTarget>_ that
includes all of the inner components exposed by the composite component
author for use by the page author.

This List must be exposed in the value set of
the composite component _BeanDescriptor_ under the key
_AttachedObjectTarget.ATTACHED_OBJECT_TARGETS_KEY_ .

For example, if the defining page has

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<composite:interface>

 <composite:editableValueHolder
name=”username” />

 <composite:actionSource name=”loginEvent” />

 <composite:actionSource name=”allEvents”

 targets=”loginEvent cancelEvent” />

<composite:interface>

|===

The list of attached object targets would
consist of instances of implementations of the following interfaces from
the package _javax.faces.webapp.vdl_ .

=== EditableValueHolderAttachedObjectTarget

ActionSource2AttachedObjectTarget

ActionSource2AttachedObjectTarget

BehaviorHolderAttachedObjectTarget

A _ValueExpression_ that evaluates to the
component type of the composite component. By default this is "
_javax.faces.NamingContainer_ " but the composite component page author
can change this, or provide a Java or script-based _UIComponent_
implementation that is required to implement _NamingContainer_ .

This _ValueExpression_ must be exposed in the
value set of the composite component _BeanDescriptor_ under the key
_UIComponent.COMPOSITE_COMPONENT_TYPE_KEY_ .

A _Map<String, PropertyDescriptor>_
representing the facets declared by the composite component author for
use by the page author.

This _Map_ must be exposed in the value set
of the composite component BeanDescriptor under the key
_UIComponent.FACETS_KEY_ .

Any attributes declared by the composite
component author using _<composite:attribute/ >_ elements must be
exposed in the array of _PropertyDescriptor_ s returned from
_getPropertyDescriptors()_ on the composite component _BeanInfo_ .

For each such attribute, for any _String_ or
_boolean_ valued _JavaBeans_ properties on the interface
_PropertyDescriptor_ (and its superinterfaces) that are also given as
attributes on a _<composite:attribute/ >_ element, those properties must
be exposed as properties on the _PropertyDescriptor_ for that markup
element. Any additional attributes on _<composite:attribute/ >_ are
exposed as attributes accessible from the _getValue()_ and
_attributeNames()_ methods on _PropertyDescriptor_ . The return type
from getValue() must be a _ValueExpression_ with the exception of the
_getValue(“type”)_ . The return type from _getValue(“type”)_ must be
_Class_ . If the value specified for the _type_ attribute of
_<cc:attribute/>_ cannot be converted to an actual _Class_ , a
_TagAttributeException_ must be thrown, including the _Tag_ and
_TagAttribute_ instances in the constructor.

The _composite component BeanDescriptor_ must
return a _Collection<String>_ when its _getValue()_ method is called
with an argument equal to the value of the symbolic constant
_UIComponent.ATTRS_WITH_DECLARED_DEFAULT_VALUES_ . The
_Collection<String>_ must contain the names of any
_<composite:attribute>_ elements for which the _default_ attribute was
specified, or _null_ if none of the attributes have been given a default
value.

[[a1707]]Component Behavior Model

This section describes the facilities for
adding Behavior attached objects to JavaServer Faces components.

=== Overview

JSF supports a mechanism for enhancing
components with additional behaviors that are not explicitly defined by
the component author.

At the root of the behavior model is he
Behavior interface. This interface serves as a supertype for additional
behavior contracts. The ClientBehavior interface extends the Behavior
interface by providing a contract for defining reusable scripts that can
be attached to any component that implements the ClientBehaviorHolder
interface. The ClientBehaviorHolder interface defines the set of attach
points, or "events", to which a ClientBehavior may be attached. For
example, an "AlertBehavior" implementation might display a JavaScript
alert when attached to a component and activated by the end user.

While client behaviors typically add
client-side capabilities, they are not limited to client. Client
behaviors can also participate in the JSF request processing lifecycle.
JSF's AjaxBehavior is a good example of such a cross-tier behavior. The
AjaxBehavior both triggers an Ajax request from the client and also
delivers AjaxBehaviorEvents to listeners on the server.

The standard HTML components provided by JSF
are all client behavior-ready. That is, all of the standard HTML
components implement the ClientBehaviorHolder interface and allow client
behaviors to be attached to well defined events. .

=== Behavior Interface

The Behavior interface is the root of the
component behavior model. It defines a single method to enable generic
behavior event delivery.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void broadcast(BehaviorEvent event)

 throws AbortProcessingException

|===

This method is called by UIComponent
implementations to re-broadcast behavior events that were queued by by
calling UIComponent.queueEvent.

=== BehaviorBase

The BehaviorBase abstract class implements
the broadcast method from the Behavior interface. BehaviorBase also
implements the PartialStateHolder interface (see
link:JSF.html#a1159[See PartialStateHolder]). It
also provides behavior event listener registration methods.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void broadcast(BehaviorEvent event)

 throws AbortProcessingException

|===

This method delivers the BehaviorEvent to
listeners that were registered via addBehaviorListener.

The following methods are provided for add
and removing BehaviorListeners..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|protected void
addBehaviorListener(BehaviorListener listener)
|===

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|protected void
removeBehaviorListener(BehaviorListener listener);
|===

=== The Client Behavior Contract

The _ClientBehavior_ interface extends the
_Behavior_ interface and lays the foundation on which behavior authors
can define custom script producing behaviors. The logic for producing
these scripts is defined in the _getScript_ () method. __

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getScript(BehaviorContext
behaviorContext)
|===

This method returns a String that is an
executable script that can be attached to a client side event handler.
The BehaviorContext argument contains information that may be useful for
getScript implementations.

In addition to client side functionality,
client behaviors can also post back to the server and participate in the
request processing lifecycle. ..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void decode(FacesContext
context,UIComponent component)
|===

This method can perform request decoding and
queue server side events..].

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Set<ClientBehaviorHint> getHints()
|===

This method provides information about the
client behavior implementation that may be useful to components and
renderers that interact with the client behavior.

Refer to the javadocs for these methods for
more details.

=== ClientBehaviorHolder

Components that support client behaviors must
implement the ClientBehaviorHolder interface. Refer to
link:JSF.html#a1239[See ClientBehaviorHolder] for
more details.

=== ClientBehaviorRenderer

Client behaviors may implement script
generation and decoding in a client behavior class or delegate to a
ClientBehaviorRenderer. Refer to
link:JSF.html#a4264[See ClientBehaviorRenderer]
for more specifics.

=== ClientBehaviorContext

The specification provides a
ClientBehaviorContext that contains information that may be used at
script rendering time. Specifically it includes:

FacesContext

UIComponent that the current behavior is
attached to

The name of the event that the behavior is
associated with

The identifier of the source - this may
correspond to the identifier of the source of the behavior

A collection of parameters that submitting
behaviors should include when posting back to the server

The ClientBehaviorContext is created with the
use of this static method:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public static ClientBehaviorContext
createClientBehaviorContext(FacesContext context,UIComponent
component,String eventName,tring
sourceId,Collection<ClientBehaviorContext.Parameter> parameters)
|===

This method must throw a NullPointerException
if context, component or eventName is null.

=== ClientBehaviorHint

The ClientBehaviorHint enum is used to convey
information about the client behavior implementation. Currently, only
one hint is provided.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|SUBMITTING
|===

This hint indicates that a client behavior
implementation posts back to the server.

=== ClientBehaviorBase

 _ClientBehaviorBase_ is an extension of
_BehaviorBase_ that implements the _ClientBehavior_ interface. It It is
a convenience class that contains default implementations for the
methods in _ClientBehavior_ plus additional methods::

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getScript(BehaviorContext
behaviorContext)
|===

The default implementation calls getRenderer
to retrieve the _ClientBehaviorRenderer_ . If a _ClientBehaviorRenderer_
is found, it is used to obtain the script. If no
_ClientBehaviorRenderer_ is found, this method returns null.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void decode(FacesContext
context,UIComponent component)
|===

The default implementation calls getRenderer
to retrieve the _ClientBehaviorRenderer_ . If a _ClientBehaviorRenderer_
is found, it is used to perform decoding. If no _ClientBehaviorRenderer_
is found, no decoding is performed.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Set<ClientBehaviorHint> getHints()
|===

The default implementation returns an empty
set

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public String getRendererType();
|===

This method identifies the
_ClientBehaviorRenderer_ type. By default, no _ClientBehaviorRenderer_
type is provided. Subclasses should either override this method to
return a valid type or override the getScript and decode methods if a
_ClientBehaviorRenderer_ is not available..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|protected ClientBehaviorRenderer
getRenderer(FacesContext context);
|===

This method returns the
_ClientBehaviorRenderer_ instance that is associated with this
ClientBehavior. It uses the renderer type returned from get
_RendererType()_ to look up the renderer on the RenderKit using
_RenderKit.getClientBehaviorRenderer._

=== Behavior Event / Listener Model

The behavior event / listener model is an
extension of the JSF event / listener model as described in
link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener Model].
BehaviorHolder components are responsible for broadcasting
BehaviorEvents to behaviors.

=== Event Classes

Behaviors can broadcast events in the same
way that UIComponents can broadcast events. At the root of the behavior
event hierarchy is BehaviorEvent that extends
_javax.faces.event.FacesEvent_ . All events that are broadcast by JSF
behaviors must extend the _javax.faces.event.BehaviorEvent_ abstract
base class. The parameter list for the constructor(s) of this event
class must include a _UIComponent_ , which identifies the component from
which the event will be broadcast to interested listeners, and a
_Behavior_ which identifies the behavior associated with the component.
The source component can be retrieved from the event object itself by
calling _getComponent_ and the behavior can be retrieved by calling
_getBehavior_ . Additional constructor parameters and/or properties on
the event class can be used to relay additional information about the
event.

In conformance to the naming patterns defined
in the _JavaBeans Specification_ , event classes typically have a class
name that ends with _Event_ . The following method is available to
determine the Behavior for the event (in addition to the other methods
inherited from _javax.faces.event.FacesEvent:_

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Behavior getBehavior()
|===

=== Listener Classes

For each event type that may be emitted, a
corresponding listener interface must be created, which extends the
_javax.faces.event.BehaviorListener_ interface. _BehaviorListener_
extends from _javax.faces.event.FacesListener._ The method signature(s)
defined by the listener interface must take a single parameter, an
instance of the event class for which this listener is being created. A
listener implementation class will implement one or more of these
listener interfaces, along with the event handling method(s) specified
by those interfaces. The event handling methods will be called during
event broadcast, one per event.

In conformance to the naming patterns defined
in the _JavaBeans Specification_ , listener interfaces have a class name
based on the class name of the event being listened to, but with the
word _Listener_ replacing the trailing _Event_ of the event class name
(thus, the listener for a _FooEvent_ would be a _FooListener_ ). It is
recommended that application event listener interfaces follow this
naming pattern as well.

=== [[a1776]]Listener Registration

 _BehaviorListener_ registration follows the
same conventions as outlined in link:JSF.html#a1776[See Listener
Registration].

=== Ajax Behavior

=== AjaxBehavior

{empty}The specification defines a single
concrete _ClientBehavior_ implementation:
_javax.faces.component.behavior.AjaxBehavior_ . This class extends
_javax.faces.component.behavior.ClientBehaviorBase_ . The presence of
this behavior on a component causes the rendering of JavaScript that
will produce an Ajax request to the server using the JavaScript API
outlined in Section “JavaScript API”. This behavior may also broadcast
_javax.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorEvents_ to registered
_javax.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorListener_ implementations. Refer to the
javadocs for more details about _AjaxBehavior._
[P1-start-ajaxbehavior]This behavior must define the behavior id
“javax.faces.behavior.Ajax”. The renderer type must also be
“javax.faces.behavior.Ajax”.[P1-end]

=== Ajax Behavior Event / Listener Model

Corresponding to the standard behavior event
classes described in the previous section the specification supports an
event listener model for broadcasting and handling _AjaxBehavior_
events.

=== javax.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorEvent

This event type extends from
_javax.faces.event.BehaviorEvent_ and it is broadcast from an
AjaxBehavior. This class follows the standard JSF event / listener
model, incorporating the usual methods as outlined in
link:JSF.html#a1300[See Event and Listener Model]. This class is
responsible for invoking the method implementation of
_javax.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorListener.processAjaxBehavior._ Refer to
the javadocs for more complete details about this class.

=== javax.faces.event.AjaxBehaviorListener

This listener type extends from
_javax.faces.event.BehaviorListener_ and it is invoked in response to
_AjaxBehaviorEvents._

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void
processAjaxBehavior(AjaxBehaviorEvent event)
|===

 _AjaxBehaviorListener_ implementations
implement this method to provide server side functionality in response
to _AjaxBehavior_ Events. See the javadocs for more details about this
class.



=== Adding Behavior To Components

Using the ClientBehaviorHolder interface
(link:JSF.html#a1239[See ClientBehaviorHolder])
_ClientBehavior_ instances can be added to components. For
_ClientBehavior_ implementations that extend _UIComponentBase_ , the
minimal requirement is to override _getEventNames()_ to return a
non-empty collection of the event names exposed by the
_ClientBehaviorHolder_ . A optional default event name may be specified
as well. For example:

Here’s an example code snippet from one of
the Html components:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public class HtmlCommandButton extends
javax.faces.component.UICommand implements ClientBehaviorHolder \{

...

private static final Collection<String>
EVENT_NAMES =
Collections.unmodifiableCollection(Arrays.asList("blur","change","click","action",...));



 public Collection<String> getEventNames() \{

 return EVENT_NAMES; }



 public String getDefaultEventName() \{

 return "action"; }

...



|===

Users of the component will be able to attach
_ClientBehavior_ instances to any of the event names specified by the
_getEventNames()_ implementation by calling
_ClientBehaviorHolder.addBehavior(eventName, clientBehavior)_ .

=== Behavior Registration

JSF provides methods for registering
_Behavior_ implementations and these methods are similar to the methods
used to register converters and validators. Refer to
link:JSF.html#a3468[See Object Factories] for the specifics
about these methods.

=== XML Registration

JSF provides the usual faces-config.xml
registration of custom component behavior implementations.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<behavior>

<behavior-id>custom.behavior.Greet</behavior-id>

<behavior-class>greet.GreetBehavior</behavior-class>

</behavior>



|===

=== Registration By Annotation

JSF provides the @FacesBehavior annotation
for registering custom behavior implementations.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
@FacesBehavior(value="custom.behavior.Greet")

public class GreetBehavior extends
BehaviorBase implements Serializable \{

...

}

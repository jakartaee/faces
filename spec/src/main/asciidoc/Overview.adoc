== Overview

Jakarta Server Faces (JSF) is a _user interface_
(UI) framework for Java web applications. It is designed to
significantly ease the burden of writing and maintaining applications
that run on a Java application server and render their UIs back to a
target client. JSF provides ease-of-use in the following ways:

Makes it easy to construct a UI from a set of
reusable UI components

Simplifies migration of application data to
and from the UI

Helps manage UI state across server requests

Provides a simple model for wiring
client-generated events to server-side application code

Allows custom UI components to be easily
built and re-used

Most importantly, JSF establishes standards
which are designed to be leveraged by tools to provide a developer
experience which is accessible to a wide variety of developer types,
ranging from corporate developers to systems programmers. A “corporate
developer” is characterized as an individual who is proficient in
writing procedural code and business logic, but is not necessarily
skilled in object-oriented programming. A “systems programmer”
understands object-oriented fundamentals, including abstraction and
designing for re-use. A corporate developer typically relies on tools
for development, while a system programmer may define his or her tool as
a text editor for writing code.

Therefore, JSF is designed to be tooled, but
also exposes the framework and programming model as APIs so that it can
be used outside of tools, as is sometimes required by systems
programmers.

=== Solving Practical Problems of the Web

JSF’s core architecture is designed to be
independent of specific protocols and markup. However it is also aimed
directly at solving many of the common problems encountered when writing
applications for HTML clients that communicate via HTTP to a Java
application server that supports servlets and Jakarta Server Pages (JSP)
based applications. These applications are typically form-based, and are
comprised of one or more HTML pages with which the user interacts to
complete a task or set of tasks. JSF tackles the following challenges
associated with these applications:

Managing UI component state across requests

Supporting encapsulation of the differences
in markup across different browsers and clients

Supporting form processing (multi-page, more
than one per page, and so on)

Providing a strongly typed event model that
allows the application to write server-side handlers (independent of
HTTP) for client generated events

Validating request data and providing
appropriate error reporting

Enabling type conversion when migrating
markup values (Strings) to and from application data objects (which are
often not Strings)

Handling error and exceptions, and reporting
errors in human-readable form back to the application user

Handling page-to-page navigation in response
to UI events and model interactions.

=== Specification Audience

The _Jakarta Server Faces Specification_ , and
the technology that it defines, is addressed to several audiences that
will use this information in different ways. The following sections
describe these audiences, the roles that they play with respect to JSF,
and how they will use the information contained in this document. As is
the case with many technologies, the same person may play more than one
of these roles in a particular development scenario; however, it is
still useful to understand the individual viewpoints separately.

=== Page Authors

A _page author_ is primarily responsible for
creating the user interface of a web application. He or she must be
familiar with the markup and scripting languages (such as HTML and
JavaScript) that are understood by the target client devices, as well as
the rendering technology (such as Jakarta Server Pages) used to create
dynamic content. Page authors are often focused on graphical design and
human factors engineering, and are generally not familiar with
programming languages such as Java or Visual Basic (although many page
authors will have a basic understanding of client side scripting
languages such as JavaScript).

Page authors will generally assemble the
content of the pages being created from libraries of prebuilt user
interface components that are provided by component writers, tool
providers, and JSF implementors. The components themselves will be
represented as configurable objects that utilize the dynamic markup
capabilities of the underlying rendering technology. When Jakarta Server
Pages are in use, for example, components will be represented as JSP
custom actions, which will support configuring the attributes of those
components as custom action attributes in the JSP page. In addition, the
pages produced by a page author will be used by the JSF framework to
create component tree hierarchies, called “views”, that represent the
components on those pages.

Page authors will generally utilize
development tools, such as HTML editors, that allow them to deal
directly with the visual representation of the page being created.
However, it is still feasible for a page author that is familiar with
the underlying rendering technology to construct pages “by hand” using a
text editor.

=== Component Writers

 _Component writers_ are responsible for
creating libraries of reusable user interface objects. Such components
support the following functionality:

Convert the internal representation of the
component’s properties and attributes into the appropriate markup
language for pages being rendered (encoding).

Convert the properties of an incoming
request—parameters, headers, and cookies—into the corresponding
properties and attributes of the component (decoding)

Utilize request-time events to initiate
visual changes in one or more components, followed by redisplay of the
current page.

Support validation checks on the syntax and
semantics of the representation of this component on an incoming
request, as well as conversion into the internal form that is
appropriate for this component.

Saving and restoring component state across
requests

As will be discussed in
<<a4219, Rendering Model>>,” the encoding and
decoding functionality may optionally be delegated to one or more
_Render Kits_ , which are responsible for customizing these operations
to the precise requirements of the client that is initiating a
particular request (for example, adapting to the differences between
JavaScript handling in different browsers, or variations in the WML
markup supported by different wireless clients).

The component writer role is sometimes
separate from other JSF roles, but is often combined. For example,
reusable components, component libraries, and render kits might be
created by:

A page author creating a custom “widget” for
use on a particular page

An application developer providing components
that correspond to specific data objects in the application’s business
domain

A specialized team within a larger
development group responsible for creating standardized components for
reuse across applications

Third party library and framework providers
creating component libraries that are portable across JSF
implementations

Tool providers whose tools can leverage the
specific capabilities of those libraries in development of JSF-based
applications

JSF implementors who provide
implementation-specific component libraries as part of their JSF product
suite

Within JSF, user interface components are
represented as Java classes that follow the design patterns outlined in
the JavaBeans Specification. Therefore, new and existing tools that
facilitate JavaBean development can be leveraged to create new JSF
components. In addition, the fundamental component APIs are simple
enough for developers with basic Java programming skills to program by
hand.

=== Application Developers

 _Application Developers_ are responsible for
providing the server-side functionality of a web application that is not
directly related to the user interface. This encompasses the following
general areas of responsibility:

Define mechanisms for persistent storage of
the information required by JSF-based web applications (such as creating
schemas in a relational database management system)

Create a Java object representation of the
persistent information, such as Entity Enterprise JavaBeans (Entity
EJBs), and call the corresponding beans as necessary to perform
persistence of the application’s data.

Encapsulate the application’s functionality,
or business logic, in Java objects that are reusable in web and non-web
applications, such as Session EJBs.

Expose the data representation and functional
logic objects for use via JSF, as would be done for any servlet- or
JSP-based application.

Only the latter responsibility is directly
related to Jakarta Server Faces APIs. In particular, the following steps are
required to fulfill this responsibility:

Expose the underlying data required by the
user interface layer as objects that are accessible from the web tier
(such as via request or session attributes in the Servlet API), via
_value reference expressions_ , as described in
<<a1823, Standard User Interface Components>>.”

Provide application-level event handlers for
the events that are enqueued by JSF components during the request
processing lifecycle, as described in <<a454, Invoke Application>>.

Application modules interact with JSF through
standard APIs, and can therefore be created using new and existing tools
that facilitate general Java development. In addition, application
modules can be written (either by hand, or by being generated) in
conformance to an application framework created by a tool provider.

=== Tool Providers

 _Tool providers_ , as their name implies,
are responsible for creating tools that assist in the development of
JSF-based applications, rather than creating such applications directly.
JSF APIs support the creation of a rich variety of development tools,
which can create applications that are portable across multiple JSF
implementations. Examples of possible tools include:

GUI-oriented page development tools that
assist page authors in creating the user interface for a web application

IDEs that facilitate the creation of
components (either for a particular page, or for a reusable component
library)

Page generators that work from a high level
description of the desired user interface to create the corresponding
page and component objects

IDEs that support the development of general
web applications, adapted to provide specialized support (such as
configuration management) for JSF

Web application frameworks (such as MVC-based
and workflow management systems) that facilitate the use of JSF
components for user interface design, in conjunction with higher level
navigation management and other services

Application generators that convert high
level descriptions of an entire application into the set of pages, UI
components, and application modules needed to provide the required
application functionality

Tool providers will generally leverage the
JSF APIs for introspection of the features of component libraries and
render kit frameworks, as well as the application portability implied by
the use of standard APIs in the code generated for an application.

=== JSF Implementors

Finally, _JSF implementors_ will provide
runtime environments that implement all of the requirements described in
this specification. Typically, a JSF implementor will be the provider of
a Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE) application server,
although it is also possible to provide a JSF implementation that is
portable across J2EE servers.

Advanced features of the JSF APIs allow JSF
implementors, as well as application developers, to customize and extend
the basic functionality of JSF in a portable way. These features provide
a rich environment for server vendors to compete on features and quality
of service aspects of their implementations, while maximizing the
portability of JSF-based applications across different JSF
implementations.

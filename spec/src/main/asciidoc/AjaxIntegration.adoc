== Ajax Integration

This chapter of the specification describes
how Ajax integrates with the Jakarta Server Faces framework to create
dynamic web applications. Jakarta Server Faces 1.2 standardized portions of
the architecture to facilitate building Web 2.0 applications with Ajax.
This chapter describes the resources and JavaScript APIs that are used
to expose the Ajax capabilities of Jakarta Server Faces to page authors and
component authors. It also describes the necessary ingredients of a
Jakarta Server Faces Ajax framework, namely, a resource delivery mechanism,
partial tree traversal, partial page update.

[[a6702]]
=== JavaScript Resource

There must be a single JavaScript resource
that exists with the resource identifier given by the value of the
constant
_jakarta.faces.application.ResourceHandler.JSF_SCRIPT_RESOURCE_NAME_ and
it must exist under the resource library given by the value of the
constant
_jakarta.faces.application.ResourceHandler.JSF_SCRIPT_LIBRARY_NAME,_
following the conventions in _<<a746, Resource
Handling>>._ This resource contains the JavaScript APIs that facilitate
Ajax interaction with Jakarta Server Faces.

[[a6704]]
=== JavaScript Resource Loading

The JavaScript resource can become available
to a Jakarta Server Faces application using a number of different
approaches.

[[a6706]]
=== The Annotation Approach

Component authors can specify that a custom
component or renderer requires the Ajax resource with the use of the
ResourceDependency annotation.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
@ResourceDependency (name="jsf.js",
library="jakarta.faces", target="head")

public class MyComponent extends UIOutput...

|===

For more information on this approach refer
to <<a847, Relocatable Resources>> and
<<a869, Resource Rendering Using Annotations>>.

[[a6712]]
=== The Resource API Approach

Component authors can also specify that a
custom component or renderer requires the JavaScript resource by using
the resource APIs. For example, a component or renderer’s encode method
may contain:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
Resource resource =
context.getApplication().getResourceHandler()

 .createResource(“jsf.js”, “jakarta.faces”);

...

writer.startElement("script", component);

writer.writeAttribute("type",
"text/javascript", "type");

writer.writeAttribute("src",((resource !=
null)? resource.getRequestPath(): "RES_NOT_FOUND"),”src”);

writer.endElement(“script”);

|===

Script resources are relocatable resources
(see <<a847, Relocatable
Resources>>) which means you can control the rendering location for these
resources by setting the “target” attribute on the resource component:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public class MyComponent extends UIOutput \{

...

getAttributes().put(“target”, “head”);

...

}

|===

This attribute must be set before the
component is added to the view. The component or renderer must also
implement the event processing method:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void processEvent(SystemEvent event)
throws AbortProcessingException \{

UIComponent component = (UIComponent)
event.getSource();

FacesContext context =
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance();

if (component.getAttributes().get("target")
!= null) \{

context.getViewRoot().addComponentResource(context,

component);

}

}



|===

When the component is added to the view, an
event will be published. This event handling method will add the
component resource to one of the resource location facets under the view
root so it will be in place before rendering.

[[a6738]]
=== The Page Declaration Language Approach

Page authors can make the Ajax resource
available to the current view using the outputScript tag. For example:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<f:view contentType=”text/html”/>

<h:head>

<meta...

<title...

</h:head>

<h:body>

...

<h:outputScript name=”jsf.js”
library=”jakarta.faces”

target=”body”/>

...

</h:body>

...



|===

[[a6754]]
=== JavaScript Namespacing

JavaScript objects that are not enclosed
within a namespace are global, which means they run the risk of
interfering, overriding and/or clobbering previously defined JavaScript
objects. This section defines the requirements for implementations
intending to use the Jakarta Server Faces 2.0 JavaScript API.

[P1-start javascript namespace]Any
implementation that intends to use the Jakarta Server Faces 2.0 JavaScript
API must define a top level JavaScript object name jsf, whose type is a
JavaScript associative array. Within that top level JavaScript object,
there must be a property named ajax..

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
if (jsf == null || typeof jsf == "undefined")
\{

 var jsf = new Object();

}

if (jsf.ajax == null || typeof jsf.ajax ==
"undefined") \{

 jsf["ajax"] = new Object();

}



|===

{empty}[P1-end]

[[a6766]]
=== Ajax Interaction

This section of the specification outlines
the Ajax JavaScript APIs that are used to initiate client side
interactions with the Jakarta Server Faces framework including partial tree
traversal and partial page update. All of the functions in this
JavaScript API will be exposed on a page scoped JavaScript object. Refer
to <<a6841, JavaScript API>> for details
about the individual API
functions.

[[a6769]]
=== Sending an Ajax Request

The JavaScript function jsf.ajax.request is
used to send information to the server to control partial view
processing (<<a6831, Partial
View Processing>>) and partial view rendering
(<<a6833, Partial View
Rendering>>). All requests using the jsf.ajax.request function will be
made asynchronously to the server. Refer to
<<a6856, Initiating an
Ajax Request>>.

[[a6771]]
=== Ajax Request Queueing

{empty}[P1-start-ajaxrequest-queue] All Ajax
requests must be put into a client side request queue before they are
sent to the server to ensure Ajax requests are processed in the order
they are sent. The request that has been waiting in the queue the
longest is the next request to be sent. After a request is sent, the
Ajax request callback function must remove the request from the queue
(also known as dequeuing). If the request completed successfully, it
must be removed from the queue. If there was an error, the client must
be notified, but the request must still be removed from the queue so the
next request can be sent. The next request (the oldest request in the
queue) must be sent. Refer to the jsf.ajax.request JavaScript
documentation for more specifics about the Ajax request queue.[P1-end]

[[a6773]]
=== Request Callback Function

The Ajax request callback function is called
when the Ajax request/response interaction is complete.
[P1-start-callback]This function must perform the following actions:

If the return status is >= 200 and < 300,
send a “complete” event following
<<a6792, Sending Events>>. Call
jsf.ajax.response passing the Ajax request object (for example the
XMLHttpRequest instance) and the request context (containing the source
DOM element, onevent event function callback and onerror error function
callback).

If the return status is outside the range
mentioned above, send a “complete” event following
<<a6792, Sending Events>>. Send an
“httpError” error following <<a6806, Signaling Errors>>.

Regardless of whether the request completed
successfully or not:

remove the completed requests (Ajax
readystate 4) from the request queue (dequeue) - specifically the
requests that have been on the queue the longest.

{empty}find the next oldest unprocessed (Ajax
readystate 0) request on the queue, and send it. The implementation must
ensure that the request that is sent does not enter the queue
again.[P1-end]

Refer to
<<a6781, Receiving
The Ajax Response>>. Also refer to the jsf.ajax.request JavaScript
documentation for more specifics about the request callback function.

[[a6781]]
=== Receiving The Ajax Response

{empty}The jsf.ajax.response function is
responsible for examining the markup that is returned from the server
and updating the client side DOM. The Ajax request callback function
should call this function when a request completes successfully.
[P1-start-ajaxresponse]The implementation of jsf.ajax.response must
handle the response as outlined in the JavaScript documentation for
jsf.ajax.response. The elements in the response must be processed in the
order they appear in the response.[P1-end]

[[a6783]]
=== Monitoring Events On The Client

JavaScript functions can be registered to be
notified during various stages of the Ajax request/response cycle.
Functions can be set up to monitor individual Ajax requests, and
functions can also be set up to monitor all Ajax requests.

[[a6785]]
=== Monitoring Events For An Ajax Request

There are two ways to monitor events for a
single Ajax request by registering an event callback function:

By using the <f:ajax> tag with the onevent
attribute.

By using the JavaScript API function
jsf.ajax.request with onevent as an option.

{empty}Refer to
<<a1111, <f:ajax>>> for details on the use of the
<f:ajax> tag approach. Refer to
<<a6856, Initiating an
Ajax Request>> for details about using the jsf.ajax.request function
approach. [P1-start-event-request]The implementation must ensure the
JavaScript function that is registered for an Ajax request must be
called in accordance with the events outlined in
<<a6936, Events>>.[P1-end]

[[a6790]]
=== Monitoring Events For All Ajax Requests

{empty}The JavaScript API provides the
jsf.ajax.addOnEvent function that can be used to register a JavaScript
function that will be notified when any Ajax request/response event
occurs. Refer to
<<a6931, Registering
Callback Functions>> for more details. The jsf.ajax.addOnEvent function
accepts a JavaScript function argument that will be notified when events
occur during any Ajax request/response event cycle. [P1-start-event] The
implementation must ensure the JavaScript function that is registered
must be called in accordance with the events outlined in
<<a6936, Events>>.[P1-end]

[[a6792]]
=== Sending Events

[P1-start-event-send]The implementation must
send events to the runtime as follows:

Construct a data payload for events using the
properties described in <<a6947,
Event Data Payload>>.

If an event handler function was registered
with the “onevent” attribute
(<<a6785,
Monitoring Events For An Ajax Request>>) call it passing the data
payload.

{empty}If any event handling functions were
registered with the “addOnEvent” function
(<<a6790,
Monitoring Events For All Ajax Requests>>) call them passing the data
payload.[P1-end]

[[a6797]]
=== Handling Errors On the Client

JavaScript functions can be registered to be
notified when Ajax requests complete with error status codes from the
server to give implementations a chance to handle the errors. Functions
can be set up to handle errors from individual Ajax requests and
functions can be setup to handle errors for all Ajax requests.

[[a6799]]
=== Handling Errors For An Ajax Request

There are two ways to handle errors for a
single Ajax request by registering an error callback function:

By using the <f:ajax> tag with the onerror
attribute.

By using the JavaScript API function
jsf.ajax.request with onerror as an option.

{empty}Refer to
<<a1111, <f:ajax>>> for details on the use of the
<f:ajax> tag approach. Refer to
<<a6856, Initiating an
Ajax Request>> for details about using the jsf.ajax.request function
approach. [P1-start-event-request]The implementation must ensure the
JavaScript function that is registered for an Ajax request must be
called in accordance when the request status code from the server is as
outlined in <<a6976, Errors>>.[P1-end]

[[a6804]]
=== Handling Errors For All Ajax Requests

{empty}The JavaScript API provides the
jsf.ajax.addOnError function that can be used to register a JavaScript
function that will be notified when an error occurs for any Ajax
request/response. Refer to
<<a6931, See Registering
Callback Functions>> for more details. The jsf.ajax.addOnError function
accepts a JavaScript function argument that will be notified when errors
occur during any Ajax request/response cycle. [P1-start-event] The
implementation must ensure the JavaScript function that is registered
must be called in accordance with the errors outlined in
<<a6976, Errors>>.[P1-end]

[[a6806]]
=== Signaling Errors

[P1-start-error-signal]The implementation
must signal errors to the runtime as follows:

Construct a data payload for errors using the
properties described in <<a6988, 
Error Data Payload>>.

If an error handler function was registered
with the “onerror” attribute
(<<a6799,
Handling Errors For An Ajax Request>>) call it passing the data payload.

If any error handling functions were
registered with the “addOnError” function
(<<a6804,
Handling Errors For All Ajax Requests>>) call them passing the data
payload.

{empty}If the project stage is “development”
(see
<<a7017,
Determining An Application’s Project Stage>>) use JavaScript “alert” to
signal the error(s).[P1-end]

[[a6812]]
=== Handling Errors On The Server

Jakarta Server Faces handles exceptions on the
server as outlined in <<a3253, ExceptionHandler>>.
[P1-start-error-server]Jakarta Server Faces Ajax frameworks must ensure
exception information is written to the response in the format:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
<partial-response id="j_id1">

<error>

<error-name>...</error-name>

<error-message>...</error-message>

</error>

</partial-response>

|===

Extract the “class” from the “Throwable”
object and write that as the contents of error-name in the response.

Extract the “cause” from the “Throwable”
object if it is available and write that as the contents of
error-message in the response. If “cause” is not available, write the
string returned from “Throwable.getMessage()”.

{empty}Implementations must ensure that an
ExceptionHandler suitable for writing exceptions to the partial response
is installed if the current request required an Ajax response
(PartialViewContext.isAjaxRequest() returns true).[P1-end]

Implementations may choose to include a
specialized ExceptionHandler for Ajax that extends from
jakarta.faces.context.ExceptionHandlerWrapper, and have the
jakarta.faces.context.ExceptionHandlerFactory implementation install it if
the environment requires it.

[[a6825]]
=== Partial View Traversal

The Jakarta Server Faces lifecycle, can be viewed
as consisting of an execute phase and a render phase.



image:lifecycle.png[image]

Partial traversal is the technique that can
be used to “visit” one or more components in the view, potentially to
have them pass through the “execute” and/or “render” phases of the
request processing lifecycle. This is a key feature for JSF and Ajax
frameworks and it allows selected components in the view to be processed
and/or rendered. There are a variety of JSF Ajax frameworks available,
and they all perform some variation of partial traversal.

[[a6829]]
=== Partial Traversal Strategy

Frameworks use a partial traversal strategy
to perform partial view processing and partial view rendering. This
specification does not dictate the use of a specific partial traversal
strategy. However, frameworks must implement their desired strategy by
implementing the PartialViewContext.processPartial method. Refer to the
JavaDocs for details about this method.

[[a6831]]
=== Partial View Processing

{empty}Partial view processing allows
selected components to be processed through the “execute” portion of the
lifecycle. Although the diagram in
<<a6825, Partial View
Traversal>> depicts the “execute” portion as encompassing everything
except the “Render Response Phase”, for the purposas of an ajax request,
the execute portion of the lifecycle is the “Apply Request Values
Phase”, “Update Model Values Phase” and “Process Validations Phase”.
Partial view processing on the server is triggered by a request from the
client. The request does not have to be an Ajax request. The request
contains special parameters that indicate the request is a partial
execute request (not triggered by Ajax) or a partial execute request
that was triggered using Ajax. The client also sends a set of client ids
of the components that must be processed through the execute phase of
the request processing lifecycle. Refer to
<<a6769, Sending an Ajax
Request>> about the request sending details. The FacesContext has methods
for retrieving the PartialViewContext instance for the request. The
PartialViewContext may also be retrieved by using the
PartialViewContextFactory class. The XML schema allows for the
definition of a PartialViewContextFactory using the
“partial-view-context-factory” element. Refer to the partial response
schema in the Javadoc section of the spec for more information on this
element. The PartialViewContext has properties and methods that indicate
the request is a partial request based on the values of these special
request parameters. Refer to the JavaDocs for
jakarta.faces.context.PartialViewContext and
<<a3229, Partial View Context>>
for the specifics of the PartialViewContext constants and methods that
facilitate partial processing. [P1-start-partialExec]The UIViewRoot
processDecodes, processValidators and processUpdates methods must
determine if the request is a partial request using the
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()
method. If
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isPartialRequest()
returns true, then the implementation of these methods must retrieve a
PartialViewContext instance and invoke
PartialViewContext.processPartial. Refer to
<<a427, Apply Request Values>>,
<<a436,
Apply Request Values Partial Processing>>,
<<a438, Process Validations>>,
<<a444,
Partial Validations Partial Processing>>, <<a446,
Update Model Values>>,
<<a452,
Update Model Values Partial Processing>>.[P1-end]

[[a6833]]
=== Partial View Rendering

{empty}Partial view rendering on the server
is triggered by a request from the client. It allows one or more
components in the view to perform the encoding process. The request
contains special parameters that indicate the request is a partial
render request. The client also sends a set of client ids of the
components that must be processed by the render phase of the request
processing lifecycle. Refer to
<<a6769, Sending an Ajax
Request>> about the request sending details. The PartialViewContext has
methods that indicate the request is a partial request based on the
values of these special request parameters. Refer to
<<a3225,
Partial Processing Methods>> for the specifics of the FacesContext
constants and methods that facilitate partial processing.
[P1-start-partialRender]The UIViewRoot getRendersChildren and
encodeChildren methods must determine if the request is an Ajax request
using the
FacesContext.getCurrentInstance().getPartialViewContext().isAjaxRequest()
method. If PartialViewContext.isAjaxRequest() returns true, then the
getRendersChildren method must return true and the encodeChildren method
must perform partial rendering using the
PartialViewContext.processPartial implementation. Refer to the JavaDocs
for UIViewRoot.encodeChildren for specific details.[P1-end]

[[a6835]]
=== Sending The Response to The Client

The Ajax response (also known as partial
response) is formulated and sent to the client during the Render
Response phase of the request processing lifecycle. The partial response
consists of markup rendered by one or more components. The response
should be in a common format so JavaScript clients can interpret the
markup in a consistent way - an important requirement for component
compatability. The agreed upon format and content type for the partial
response is XML. This means there should be a ResponseWriter suitable
for writing the response in XML. The UIViewRoot.encodeChildren method
delegates to a partial traversal strategy. The partial traversal
strategy implementation produces the partial response. The markup that
is sent to the client must contain elements that the client can
recognize. In addition to the markup produced by server side components,
the response must contain “instructions” for the client to interpret, so
the client will know, for example, that it is to add new markup to the
client DOM, or update existing areas of the DOM. When the response is
sent back to the client, it must contain the view state.
[P1-start-sending-response]Implementations must adhere to the response
format as specified in the JavaScript docs for
jsf.ajax.response.[P1-end] Refer to the XML schema definition in the
<<a7162,See XML Schema Definition for Composite
Components>> section. This XML schema is another important area for
component library compatability.

[[a6837]]
=== Writing The Partial Response

Jakarta Server Faces provides
jakarta.faces.context.PartialResponseWriter to ensure the Ajax response
that is written follows the standard format as specified in
<<a7162, XML Schema Definition for Composite
Components>>. Implementations must take care to properly handle nested
CDATA sections when writing the response. PartialResponseWriter
decorates an existing ResponseWriter implementation by extending
jakarta.faces.context.ResponseWriterWrapper. Refer to the
jakarta.faces.context.PartialResponseWriter JavaDocs, and the JavaScript
documentation for the jsf.ajax.response function for more specifics.

== Lifecycle Management

In <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a369,See Request
Processing Lifecycle>>, the required functionality of each phase of the
request processing lifecycle was described. This chapter describes the
standard APIs used by JSF implementations to manage and execute the
lifecycle. Each of these classes and interfaces is part of the
_jakarta.faces.lifecycle_ package.

Page authors, component writers, and
application developers, in general, will not need to be aware of the
lifecycle management APIs—they are primarily of interest to tool
providers and JSF implementors.

=== Lifecycle

Upon receipt of each JSF-destined request to
this web application, the JSF implementation must acquire a reference to
the _Lifecycle_ instance for this web application, and call its
_execute()_ and _render()_ methods to perform the request processing
lifecycle. The _Lifecycle_ instance invokes appropriate processing logic
to implement the required functionality for each phase of the request
processing lifecycle, as described in <<RequestProcessingLifecycle.adoc#a401,See
Standard Request Processing Lifecycle Phases>>.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void execute(FacesContext context)
throws FacesException;



public void render(FacesContext context)
throws FacesException;

|===

The _execute()_ method performs phases up to,
but not including, the _Render Response_ phase. The _render()_ method
performs the Render Response phase. This division of responsibility
makes it easy to support Jakarta Server Faces processing in a portlet-based
environment.

As each phase is processed, registered
_PhaseListener_ instances are also notified. The general processing for
each phase is as follows:

From the set of registered _PhaseListener_
instances, select the relevant ones for the current phase, where
“relevant” means that calling _getPhaseId()_ on the _PhaseListener_
instance returns the phase identifier of the current phase, or the
special value _PhaseId.ANY_PHASE_ .

Call the _beforePhase()_ method of each
relevant listener, in the order that the listeners were registered.

If no called listener called the
_FacesContext.renderResponse()_ or _FacesContext.responseComplete()_
method, execute the functionality required for the current phase.

Call the _afterPhase()_ method of each
relevant listener, in the reverse of the order that the listeners were
registered.

If the _FacesContext.responseComplete()_
method has been called during the processing of the current request, or
we have just completed the _Render Response_ phase, perform no further
phases of the request processing lifecycle.

If the _FacesContext.renderResponse()_ method
has been called during the processing of the current request, and we
have not yet executed the _Render Response_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle, ensure that the next executed phase will be
_Render Response_

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void addPhaseListener(PhaseListener
listener);



public void removePhaseListener(PhaseListener
listener);

|===

These methods register or deregister a
_PhaseListener_ that wishes to be notified before and after the
processing of each standard phase of the request processing lifecycle.
Implementations should prevent duplicate _PhaseListener_ registrations
and log an exception if an attempt is made. The webapp author can
declare a _PhaseListener_ to be added using the _phase-listener_ element
of the application configuration resources file. Please see
_<<LifecycleManagement.adoc#a6635,See PhaseListener>>_ .


[[a6626]]
=== PhaseEvent

This class represents the beginning or ending
of processing for a particular phase of the request processing
lifecycle, for the request encapsulated by the _FacesContext_ instance
passed to our constructor.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public PhaseEvent(FacesContext context,
PhaseId phaseId, Lifecycle lifecycle);
|===

Construct a new _PhaseEvent_ representing the
execution of the specified phase of the request processing lifecycle, on
the request encapsulated by the specified _FacesContext_ instance. The
_Lifecycle_ instance must be the lifecycle used by the current
_FacesServlet_ that is processing the request. It will serve as the
_source_ of the _java.util.EventObject_ from which _PhaseEvent_
inherits.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public FacesContext getFacesContext();



public PhaseId getPhaseId();

|===

Return the properties of this event instance.
The specified _FacesContext_ instance will also be returned if
_getSource()_ (inherited from the base _EventObject_ class) is called.


[[a6635]]
=== PhaseListener

This interface must be implemented by objects
that wish to be notified before and after the processing for a
particular phase of the request processing lifecycle, on a particular
request. Implementations of _PhaseListener_ must be programmed in a
thread-safe manner.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public PhaseId getPhaseId();
|===

The _PhaseListener_ instance indicates for
which phase of the request processing lifecycle this listener wishes to
be notified. If _PhaseId.ANY_PHASE_ is returned, this listener will be
notified for all standard phases of the request processing lifecycle.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
public void beforePhase(PhaseEvent event);



public void afterPhase(PhaseEvent event);

|===

{empty}The beforePhase() method is called
before the standard processing for a particular phase is performed,
while the afterPhase() method is called after the standard processing
has been completed. The JSF implementation must guarantee that, if
_beforePhase()_ has been called on a particular instance, then
_afterPhase()_ will also be called, regardless of any Exceptions that
may have been thrown during the actual execution of the lifecycle phase.
For example, let’s say there are three PhaseListeners attached to the
lifecycle: _A, B_ , and _C_ , in that order. _A.beforePhase()_ is
called, and executes successfully. _B.beforePhase()_ is called and
throws an exception. [P1-start_publishExceptionBefore] Any exceptions
thrown during the _beforePhase()_ listeners must be caught and published
to the _ExceptionHandler_ , as described
below.[P1-end_publishExceptionBefore] In this example, _C.beforePhase()_
must not be called. Then the actual lifecycle phase executes. Any
exceptions thrown during the execution of the actual phase, that reach
the runtime code that implements the JSF lifecycle phase,
[P1-start_publishExceptionDuring] must be caught and and published to
the _ExceptionHandler_ , as described
below[P1-end_publishExceptionDuring]. When the lifecycle phase exits,
due to an exeception or normal termination, the _afterPhase()_ listeners
must be called in reverse order from the _beforePhase()_ listeners in
the following manner. _C.afterPhase()_ must not be called, since
_C.beforePhase()_ was not called. _B.afterPhase()_ must not be called,
since _B.beforePhase()_ did not execute successfully. _A.afterPhase()_
must be called. [P1-start_publishExceptionAfter]Any exceptions thrown
during the _afterPhase()_ liseteners must be caught and published to the
_ExceptionHandler_ , as described below.[P1-start_publishExceptionAfter]

The previous paragraph detailed several cases
where exceptions should be published to the _Exception_ handler.
[P1-start_publishExceptionSpec] The following action must be taken by
the runtime to implement this requirement as well as an additional
requirent to cause the _ExceptionHandler_ to take action on the
published _Exception_ (s). The specification is shown in pseudocode.
This code does not implement the before/after matching guarantees
specified above and is only intended to describe the specification for
publishing and handling _ExceptionQueuedEvent_ instances that arise from
exceptions being thrown during the execution of a lifecycle phase.
Methods shown in _thisTypeface()_ are not a part of the API and are just
included for discussion.

{empty}[P1-end_publishExceptionSpec]

_PhaseListener_ implementations may affect
the remainder of the request processing lifecycle in several ways,
including:

Calling _renderResponse()_ on the
_FacesContext_ instance for the current request, which will cause
control to transfer to the _Render Response_ phase of the request
processing lifecycle, once processing of the current phase is complete.

Calling responseComplete() on the
FacesContext instance for the current request, which causes processing
of the request processing lifecycle to terminate once the current phase
is complete.


=== LifecycleFactory

A single instance of
_jakarta.faces.lifecycle.LifecycleFactory_ must be made available to each
JSF-based web application running in a servlet or portlet container. The
factory instance can be acquired by JSF implementations or by
application code, by executing:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
a|
LifecycleFactory factory = (LifecycleFactory)


FactoryFinder.getFactory(FactoryFinder.LIFECYCLE_FACTORY);

|===

The _LifecycleFactory_ implementation class
supports the following methods:

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public void addLifecycle(String lifecycleId,
Lifecycle lifecycle);
|===

Register a new _Lifecycle_ instance under the
specified lifecycle identifier, and make it available via calls to the
_getLifecycle_ method for the remainder of the current web application’s
lifetime.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Lifecycle getLifecycle(String
lifecycleId);
|===

The _LifecycleFactory_ implementation class
provides this method to create (if necessary) and return a _Lifecycle_
instance. All requests for the same lifecycle identifier from within the
same web application will return the same _Lifecycle_ instance, which
must be programmed in a thread-safe manner.

Every JSF implementation must provide a
_Lifecycle_ instance for a default lifecycle identifier that is
designated by the _String_ constant _LifecycleFactory.DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE_
. For advanced uses, a JSF implementation may support additional
lifecycle instances, named with unique lifecycle identifiers.

[width="100%",cols="100%",]
|===
|public Iterator<String> getLifecycleIds();
|===

This method returns an iterator over the set
of lifecycle identifiers supported by this factory. This set must
include the value specified by _LifecycleFactory.DEFAULT_LIFECYCLE_ .
